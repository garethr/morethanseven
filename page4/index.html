      <a href="/2014/04/25/consul/">
        Consul, DNS and Dnsmasq
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>While at <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014">Craft</a> I decided to have a quick look at
<a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The <a href="http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html">Introduction</a>
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.</p>

<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>I&#39;m running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt-get install dnsmasq
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>All we&#39;re doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you&#39;ve changed the consul defaults this should work.</p>

<p>Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
<a href="https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="k">include</span> <span class="na">dnsmasq</span>
<span class="na">dnsmasq</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="na">conf</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;consul&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="na">ensure</span>  <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">content</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig @127.0.0.1 -p <span class="m">8600</span> web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.</p>

        Testing Vagrant runs with Cucumber
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> since it&#39;s
initial release and still find myself using it for various tasks.</p>

<p>Recently I&#39;ve been using it to test collections of Puppet modules. For a
single host
<a href="https://github.com/jvoorhis/vagrant-serverspec">vagrant-serverspec</a> is
excellent. Simply install the plugin, add a provisioner and write your
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> tests. The serverspec provisioner
looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:serverspec</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pattern</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;*_spec.rb&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But I also found myself wanting to test behaviour from the host
(serverspec tests are run on the guest), and also wanted to write tests
that checked the behaviour of a multi-box setup. I started by simply
writing some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> tests which I ran locally,
but I decided I wanted this integrated with vagrant. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrant-cucumber-host">vagrant-cucumber-host</a>.
This implements a new vagrant provisioner which runs a set of cucumber
features locally.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:cucumber</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">features</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Just drop your features in the features folder and run <code>vagrant
provision</code>. If you just want to run the cucumber features, without any
of the other provisioners running you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vagrant provision --provision-with cucumber
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another advantage of writing this as a vagrant plugin is that it uses
the Ruby bundled with vagrant, meaning you just install the plugin
rather than faff about with a local Ruby install. </p>

<p>A couple of other vagrant plugins that I&#39;ve used to make the testing
setup easier are <a href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">vagrant-hostsupdater</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts">vagrant-hosts</a>. Both
help with managing hosts files, which makes writing tests without
knowing the IP addresses easier.</p>

        Buy vs Build your Monitoring System
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>At the excellent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/feb/15/london-devops-meetup-held-at-the-guardian">London Devops meetup</a> last week I asked what was
apparently a controversial question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should you just use software as a service monitoring products rather than integrate lots of open source tools?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got a few people worked up and I promised a blog post.</p>

<p>Note that I wrote a post listing lots of <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2013/10/13/looking-into-monitoring-and-logging-tools/">open source monitoring tools</a>
not that long ago. And I&#39;ve been to both the
<a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> events about open source
monitoring. And have a bunch of <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr?q=monitoring">Puppet modules for open source monitoring tools</a>. I&#39;m
a fan of both open source and of open source monitoring. Please don&#39;t
read this as an attack on either, and particularly on the work of
awesome people working on  great open source monitoring products.</p>

<h2>Some assumptions</h2>

<ol>
<li>No one product exists that does everything. I think this is true for
SaaS as much as for open source.</li>
<li>Lets work with about 200 hosts. This is a somewhat arbitrary number I
know, some people will have more and others less.</li>
<li>If it saves money we&#39;ll pay yearly, rather than monthly or hourly.</li>
<li>We could probably get some volume discounts from some of the
suppliers, but we&#39;ll use list prices for this post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Show me the money</h2>

<p>So what would it cost to get up and running with a state of the art
software as a service monitoring system? In order to do this we need to
choose our software. For this post that means I&#39;m going to pick products
I&#39;ve used (sometimes only a bit) and like. This isn&#39;t a comprehensive
study of all the alternatives I&#39;m afraid - though feel free to write
your own alternative blog posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> provides a crazy amount of data about
the running of both your servers and your applications. This includes
application performance data, errors, low level metrics and even rolled
up method or database query performance. $149 per host per month for our
200 hosts gives us <em>$29,800</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metrics.librato.com">Librato Metrics</a> provides a fantastic way
of storing arbitrary time series data. We&#39;re already storing lots of
data in New Relic but Metrics provides us with less opinionated software
so we can use it for anything, for instance number of logins or searches
or other business level metrics. We&#39;ll go for a plan with 200 data sources, 100 metrics each and at 10 second resolution for a cost of <em>$3,860</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">Pagerduty</a> is all about the alerts side of
monitoring. Most of the other SaaS tools we&#39;ve chosen integrate with it
so we can make sure we get actionable emails and SMS messages to the
right people at the right time. Our plan costs $18 per person per month, 
so lets say we have 30 people at a cost of <em>$540</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> is all about logs. Simple setup
your servers with syslog and Papertrail will collect, analyze and store
all your log messages. You get a browser based interface, search tools
and the ability to setup alerts. We like lots of logs so we&#39;ll have a
plan for 2 weeks of search, 1 year archive and 100GB month of log
traffic. That all costs <em>$575</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.getsentry.com">Sentry</a> is all about exceptions. We could be
simply logging these and sending them to Papertrail but Sentry provides
tools for tracking and rolling up occurences. We&#39;ll go for a plan with
90 days of history and 200 events per minute at a cost of <em>$199</em> a
month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a> used to provide a very simple
external check service, but now they have added more complex multistage
checks as well as real user monitoring to the basic ping. We&#39;ll choose
the plan with 250 checks, 20 Real User Monitoring sites and 500 SMS
alerts for <em>$107 a month</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How much!</h2>

<p>In total that all comes to <em>$35,080 (£20,922)</em> per month, or
<em>$420,960 (£251,062)</em> per year.</p>

<p>Now the first reaction of lots of people will be <em>that&#39;s a lot of money</em>
and it is. But remember open source isn&#39;t free either. We need to pay
for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The servers we run our monitoring software on</li>
<li>The people to operate those servers</li>
<li>The people to install and configure our monitoring software</li>
<li>The office space and other costs of employing people (like management
and hiring)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think people with the ability to build software tend to forget they
are expensive, whether as a contractor or as a full time member of
staff. And people without management experience tend to forget costs
like insurance, rent, management overhead, recruitment, etc.</p>

<p>And probably more important than these for some people we need to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>The time taken to build a good open source monitoring system</li>
</ul>

<p>The time needed to put together a good monitoring stack based on for
instance logstash, kibana, riemann, sensu, graphite and collectd isn&#39;t
small. And don&#39;t forget the number of other moving parts like redis,
rabbitmq and elasticsearch that need installing configuring and
maintaining. That probably means compromising in the short term or
shipping later. In a small team how core is building your monitoring
stack to what you do as a business?</p>

<h2>But I can&#39;t use SaaS</h2>

<p>For some people, using a software as a service product just isn&#39;t going
to cut it. Here&#39;s a list of reasons I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regulation constrains where your data can be stored, for instance it&#39;s
not allowed out of the country</li>
<li>Sheer size of infrastructure, although you may be able to get a volume
discount it might not be enough</li>
</ul>

<p>I think everything else is a cost/benefit issue or personal preference
(or bias). Happy to add more to that list, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very
long list.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve purposefully not talked about the quality of the tools here, just
the cost. I&#39;ve also not mentioned that it&#39;s likely not an all or nothing
decision, lots of people will mix SaaS products and open source tools.</p>

<p>Whether taking a SaaS approach will be quicker, cheaper or better will
depend on your specific business context. But try and make that about
the organisation and not about the technology.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never used the current crop of SaaS monitoring
tools (and not just the one&#39;s mentioned above) then I think you&#39;re missing
out. Even if you stick with a mainly open source monitoring stack you
might look at your tools a bit differently after you&#39;ve experimented
with some of the commercial competition.</p>

      <a href="/2014/02/05/a-template-for-puppet-modules/">
        A template for Puppet modules
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>A little while ago I published a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton">template writing your own puppet modules</a>. It&#39;s
very opinionated but comes out of the box with lots of the tools you
eventually find and add to your tool box. I&#39;m posting this as it came
up at the recent <a href="http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu">Configuration Management Camp</a>
and after discussing it I realised I hadn&#39;t actually wrote anything
about it anywhere.</p>

<h2>What do you get?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A simple install, config, service class pattern</li>
<li>Unit tests with <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet">rspec-puppet</a></li>
<li>Rake tasks for <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/puppet-lint">linting</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-syntax">syntax checking</a></li>
<li>Integration tests using <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker">Beaker</a></li>
<li>A Modulefile to provide Forge metadata</li>
<li>Command line tools to upload to the Forge with <a href="https://github.com/maestrodev/puppet-blacksmith">blacksmith</a></li>
<li>A README based on the Puppetlabs documentation standards</li>
<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis CI</a> configuration based on the official
Puppetlabs support matrix</li>
<li>A Guardfile which can run all the tests when you change manifests</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously you can choose not to use parts of this, or even delete
aspects, but I find that approach much quicker than starting from scratch
or copying files from previous modules and changing names.</p>

<h2>How can I use it?</h2>

<p>Simple. The following will install the module skeleton to
<code>~/.puppet/var/puppet-module/skeleton</code>. This turns out to be picked up
by the Puppet module tool.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">git clone https://github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton 
<span class="nb">cd </span>puppet-module-skeleton
find skeleton -type f <span class="p">|</span> git checkout-index --stdin --force --prefix<span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;$HOME/.puppet/var/puppet-module/&quot;</span> --
</code></pre></div>
<p>With that in place you can then just run the following to create a new
module, where puppet-ntp is the name of our new module.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">puppet module generate puppet-ntp
</code></pre></div>
<p>We use <code>puppet module</code> like this rather than just copying the files
because otherwise you would have to rename everything from class names
to test assertions. The skeleton actually contains erb templates in
places, and running <code>puppet module generate</code> results in the module name
being available to those templates.</p>

<h2>Now what?</h2>

<p>Assuming you have run the above commands you should have a folder called
<code>puppet-ntp</code> in your current directory. <code>cd</code> into that and then install
the dependencies:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle install
</code></pre></div>
<p><a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler </a>is a dependency manager for Ruby. If you
don&#39;t already have it installed you should be able to do so with the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gem install bundler
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you have the dependencies why not run the full test suite? This
checks syntax, lints the Puppet code and runs the unit tests.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rake <span class="nb">test</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Unit tests give fast feedback and help make sure the code you write is
going to do what you intend, but they aren&#39;t actually applying the
manifests to a real machine. For that you want an integration test.
You&#39;ll need <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> installed for this next
step. Lets run those as well with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>rspec spec/acceptance
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will take a while, especially the first time. This uses Beaker to
download a virtual machine from Puppetlabs (if you don&#39;t already have
it) and then brings up a new machine, applies a simple manifest, runs
the acceptance tests and then destroys the machine.</p>

<p>The <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file has more information for running the test
suite.</p>

<h2>What&#39;s new?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve recently added a <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guardfile</a> to
help with testing. You can run this with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>guard
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now in a separate tab or pane make a change to any of the manifests. The
tests should run automatically in the tab or pane where guard is
running.</p>

<h2>Can you add this new tool?</h2>

<p>Probably. Although I started the repo a few other people have
contributed code or made improvements already. Just sent a pull request
or open an issue.</p>

      <a href="/2014/01/25/code-coverage-for-puppet-modules/">
        Code coverage for Puppet modules
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>One of my favourite topics for a while now has been <em>infrastructure as
code</em>. Part of that involves introducing well understood programming
techniques to infrastructure - from test driven design, to refactoring
and version control. One tool I&#39;m fond of (even with it&#39;s potential to
be misused) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">code coverage</a>. I&#39;d been meaning
to go code spelunking to see if this could be done for testing Puppet
modules. </p>

<p>The functionality is now in <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet#producing-coverage-reports">master for rspec-puppet</a>
and so anyone feeling brave can use it now, or if you must wait for the
2.0.0 release. The actual implementation is inspired by the same functionality in
<a href="https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec#reporting">ChefSpec</a>
written by <a href="https://sethvargo.com/">Seth Vargo</a>. Lots of the how came
from here, and the usage is very similar.</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

<p>First add (or hopefully change) your Gemfile line item for rspec-puppet
to the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s2">&quot;rspec-puppet&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:git</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">&#39;https://github.com/rodjek/rspec-puppet.git&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then all you need to do is include the following line anywhere in a
spec.rb file in your spec directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="na">at_exit</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">RSpec</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="na">Puppet</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="na">Coverage</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="na">report</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>What do I get?</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s an <a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-nginx">example module</a>,
including a file called
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-nginx/blob/master/spec/classes/coverage_spec.rb">coverage_spec.rb</a>.
When running the test suite with <code>rake spec</code> you now get coverage
details like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Total resources:   24
Touched resources: 8
Resource coverage: 33.33%

Untouched resources:
  Class[Nginx]

  File[sources.list.d]
  Exec[e407f76c6e349fc397947a4a49260a9320196cb1]
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here&#39;s the output on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/garethr-nginx/jobs/17597307#L105">Travis CI</a> as
well for a recent build.</p>

<h2>Why is this useful?</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve already found coverage useful when writing tests for a few of my
puppet modules. The information about the total number of resouces is
interesting (and potentially an indicator of complexity) but the list of
untouched resources is the main useful part. These represent both
information about what your module is doing, and potential things you
might want to test.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping to find some more time to make this even better, providing
more information about untouched resources, adding some configuration
options and hopefully to integrate with the <a href="https://coveralls.io/docs/api">Coveralls API</a>.</p>
