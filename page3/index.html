        Using Puppet with key/value config stores
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>I like the central idea behind storing configuration in something like
<a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">Etcd</a> rather than lots of files on lots
of disks, but a few challenges still remain. Things that spring to mind
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are all your passwords now available to all of your nodes?</li>
<li>How do I know when configuration changed and who changed it?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ll leave the first of those for today (although have a look at
<a href="http://www.conjur.net/">Conjur</a> as one approach to this). For the second,
I&#39;m quite fond of plain text, pull requests and a well tested deployment
pipeline. Before Etcd (or <a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> or similar) you
would probably have values in Hiera or Data Bags or similar and inject them
into files on hosts using your configuration management tool of choice. So
lets just do the same with our new-fangled distributed configuration store.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="na">key_value_config</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;/foo&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="na">ensure</span>   <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">provider</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="na">etcd</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">value</span>    <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Say you wanted to switch over to using Consul instead? Just switch the provider.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="na">key_value_config</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;/foo&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="na">ensure</span>   <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">provider</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="na">consul</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">value</span>    <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;bar&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You&#39;d probably move all of that out into something like hiera, and then generate
the above resources, but you get the idea.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">etcd_values</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">foo</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">bar</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above is implemented in a very simple
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-key_value_config">proof of concept Puppet module</a>.
Anyone with any feedback please do let me know.</p>

        Leaving GDS never easy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2014</span>

    <p><em>The following is the email I sent to lots of my colleagues at the 
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> last week.</em></p>

<p>So, after 3 rather exciting years I&#39;ve decided to leave GDS.</p>

<p>That&#39;s surprisingly difficult to write if I&#39;m honest.</p>

<p>I was part of the team that built and shipped the beta of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
Since then I&#39;ve worked across half of what has become GDS, equally
helping and frustrating (then hopefully helping) lots of you. I&#39;ve
done a great deal and learnt even more, as well as collected arcane
knowledge about government infosec and the dark arts of procurement
along the way. I&#39;ve done, and helped others do, work I wouldn&#39;t even
have thought possible (or maybe likely is the right word?) when I
started.</p>

<p>So why leave? For all the other things I do I&#39;m basically a tool
builder. So I&#39;m going off to work for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a> to build
infrastructure tools that don&#39;t suck. That sort of pretty specific
work is something that <em>should</em> be done outside government in my
opinion. I&#39;m a pretty firm believer in &quot;government should only do what
only government can do&quot; (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">design principle number 2</a> for those that
haven&#39;t memorised them yet). And if I&#39;m honest, focusing on something
smaller than fixing a country&#39;s civic infrastructure is appealing for
now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you in on a secret; I didn&#39;t join what became GDS because of
the GOV.UK project. I joined to work with friends I&#39;d not yet had the
chance to work with and to see the inside of a growing organisation
from the start. I remember <a href="http://twitter.com/tomskitomski">Tom Loosemore</a> promising me we&#39;d be 200
people in 3 years! As far as anyone knows we&#39;re 650+ people. That&#39;s
about a person a day for 2 years. I&#39;m absolutely not saying that came
without a cost, but for me being part of that that was part of the
point - so I can be a little accepting with hindsight.</p>

<p>For me, apart from all the short term things (side-note: this job now
has me thinking Â£10million is a small amount of money and 2 years is a
small amount of time) there is one big mission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make government a sustainable part of the UK tech community</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means in 10 years time experienced tech people from across the
country, as well as people straight from university, choosing to work
for government. Not just for some abstract and personal reason (though
that&#39;s fine too), but because it&#39;s a a genuinely interesting place to
work. That one&#39;s on us.</p>

        Using OWASP ZAP from the command line
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP ZAP</a> or
the Zed Attack Proxy. It&#39;s suprisingly user friendly and nicely pulls of
it&#39;s aim of being useful to developers as well as more hardcore penetration testers.</p>

<p>One of the features I&#39;m particularly fond of is the aforementioned
proxy. Basically it can act as a transparent HTTP proxy, recording the
traffic, and then analyse that to conduct various active security tests;
looking for XSS issues or directory traversal vulnerabilities for
instance. The simplest way of seeding the ZAP with something to analyse is using
the simple inbuilt spider.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Unfortunately ZAP isn&#39;t designed to be used from the
command line. It&#39;s either a thick client, or it&#39;s a proxy with a simple
API. Enter <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr">Zapr</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a pretty simple wrapper around the ZAP API (using the
<a href="https://github.com/vpereira/owasp_zap">owasp_zap</a> library under the
hood). All it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch the proxy in headless mode</li>
<li>Trigger the spider</li>
<li>Launch various attacks against the collected URLs</li>
<li>Print out the results</li>
</ul>

<p>This is fairly limited, in that a spider isn&#39;t going to work
particularly well for a mor interactive application, but it&#39;s a farily good
starting point. I may add different seed methods in the future (or would
happily accept pull requests). Usage wise it&#39;s as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">zapr --summary http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre></div>
<p>That will print you out something like the following, assuming it finds
an issue.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Alert                             | Risk     | URL                                    |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)  | High     |http://localhost:3000/forgot_password   |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above alert is taken from a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr-example">simple example</a>,
using the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat">RailsGoat</a> vulnerable web
application as a scape goat. You can see the resulting output from
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/zapr-example">Travis running the tests</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a bit of a proof of concept so it&#39;s not particularly robust or
well tested. Depending on usage and interest I may tidy it up and extend
it, or I may leave it as a useful experiment and try and finally get ZAP
support into <a href="http://gauntlt.org">Gauntlt</a>, only time will tell.</p>

      <a href="/2014/04/25/consul/">
        Consul, DNS and Dnsmasq
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>While at <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014">Craft</a> I decided to have a quick look at
<a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The <a href="http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html">Introduction</a>
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.</p>

<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>I&#39;m running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt-get install dnsmasq
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>All we&#39;re doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you&#39;ve changed the consul defaults this should work.</p>

<p>Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
<a href="https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="k">include</span> <span class="na">dnsmasq</span>
<span class="na">dnsmasq</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="na">conf</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;consul&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="na">ensure</span>  <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">content</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig @127.0.0.1 -p <span class="m">8600</span> web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.</p>

        Testing Vagrant runs with Cucumber
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> since it&#39;s
initial release and still find myself using it for various tasks.</p>

<p>Recently I&#39;ve been using it to test collections of Puppet modules. For a
single host
<a href="https://github.com/jvoorhis/vagrant-serverspec">vagrant-serverspec</a> is
excellent. Simply install the plugin, add a provisioner and write your
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> tests. The serverspec provisioner
looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:serverspec</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pattern</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;*_spec.rb&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But I also found myself wanting to test behaviour from the host
(serverspec tests are run on the guest), and also wanted to write tests
that checked the behaviour of a multi-box setup. I started by simply
writing some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> tests which I ran locally,
but I decided I wanted this integrated with vagrant. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrant-cucumber-host">vagrant-cucumber-host</a>.
This implements a new vagrant provisioner which runs a set of cucumber
features locally.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:cucumber</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">features</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Just drop your features in the features folder and run <code>vagrant
provision</code>. If you just want to run the cucumber features, without any
of the other provisioners running you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vagrant provision --provision-with cucumber
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another advantage of writing this as a vagrant plugin is that it uses
the Ruby bundled with vagrant, meaning you just install the plugin
rather than faff about with a local Ruby install. </p>

<p>A couple of other vagrant plugins that I&#39;ve used to make the testing
setup easier are <a href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">vagrant-hostsupdater</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts">vagrant-hosts</a>. Both
help with managing hosts files, which makes writing tests without
knowing the IP addresses easier.</p>
