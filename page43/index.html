        Sorry, but the Flickr API isn&#39;t REST
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>After <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org">SemanticCamp</a> me and <a href="http://icepop.org/">Rey</a> popped in to see <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com/">Osmosoft</a> towers. A good few interesting conversations ensued, including one about the difference between <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/02/19/mashup-or-integration/">mashups and integration</a>. All good fun basically. <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/">Simon</a> also had an <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/2008/02/21/off-the-shelf-integration-in-enterprises/">interesting take on the topic</a> as well.</p>
<p>What has all this to do with the topic of this post? Well, Simon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When compared to small RESTful APIs like flickr and twitter&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not really picking on Simon here, more that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write something on this topic for a while and this proved a good catalyst for a little rant.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"><span class="caps">API</span></a> is pretty darn cool. But it&#8217;s not RESTful in pretty much any way you want to shake a stick at it. It&#8217;s a well designed <span class="caps">RPC</span> (remote procedure call) <span class="caps">API</span>. Now even flickr get this wrong. They even have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/response.rest.html">a page</a> which confuses the issue and makes <span class="caps">REST</span> out to be a response format based on <span class="caps">XML</span>. Bad flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html">flickr states</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">REST</span> Endpoint <span class="caps">URL</span> is http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turns out to be completely against the whole RESTful principles. Lets try and explain. You can define most of what you want to do with an <span class="caps">API</span> with the use of nouns, verbs and content types. <span class="caps">REST</span> is based around limiting the set of verbs to those available in <span class="caps">HTTP</span>; for instance <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span class="caps">DELETE</span>. For any given application or <span class="caps">API</span> you&#8217;ll also specify a set of content types (representations); for instance <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">JSON</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>. All you get to play around with are the nouns, in the case of the web these are our URLs.</p>
<p>In a typical <span class="caps">RPC</span> style <span class="caps">API</span> you have one <span class="caps">URL</span> (like flickr does) which acts as the end point to which all calls are made. You then probably define a few functions which you can call. Lets look at a simple book example.</p>
<pre><code>getBook()
deleteBook()
createBook()
editBook()</code></pre>
<p>The RESTful way of designing this might look a little bit more like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET     /books/{book-id}
DELETE  /books/{book-id}
POST    /books
PUT     /books/{book-id}</code></pre>
<p>We mentioned content types or representations earlier. Lets say instead of the default response format we might want to get a <span class="caps">JSON</span> representation of a given book we might do something like the following.</p>
<pre><code>GET /books/{book-id}.json</code></pre>
<p>The advantages of using URLs as the <span class="caps">API</span> nouns in this way include more than just sane URLs for the site or application in question. The web is based around many of these architectural principles and that seemed to scale pretty well. The idea is that fell envisaged RESTful applications have an advantage here too. For me one of the real benefits of RESTful APIs are in the simplicity they bring to documentation. I already know the available verbs, all I need to know are the set of resource URLs and I can probably use <span class="caps">CURL</span> to work out the <span class="caps">REST</span> (sorry, bad pun).</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is pretty common. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">WikiPedia</a> appreciates their is a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between the uses of the term â€œRESTâ€ causes some confusion in technical discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just pedantry on my part, well not quite. I&#8217;d recommend anyone involved in designing and architecting web sites read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260">RESTful Web Services</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/">Roy Fielding&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. But if you just want to <em>get</em> the general principles and don&#8217;t fancy wading through technical documents then you have to read <a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained <span class="caps">REST</span> to My Wife</a> hilariously written by <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, just because an <span class="caps">API</span> makes use of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> doesn&#8217;t make it RESTful. I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I had a great time at <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org/">SemanticCamp</a> over the weekend which was not too much of a surprise. What was a surprise was getting back home to find out that I&#8217;ve been invited to join the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> (WaSP) on the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/edutf">Education Task Force</a>. I even have my <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/grushgrove/">own page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting me guys. Anyone who has had the misfortune of having me present during a discussion of the current state of web education knows it&#8217;s one of my favourite subjects. Hopefully I can make myself useful around the place and help with getting a few things done. More on this when I know more but in the meantime feel free to pester me endlessly if you have a particular axe to grind.</p>

        Example of the Yahoo Live Api
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2008</span>

    <p><a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a> launched recently along with a nice <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/">RESTful <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the beauty of <span class="caps">REST</span> being in lowering the barrier to hacking and when I wanted a quick feature for Live it was simplicity itself to put together.</p>
<p>A few friends are using it far too much it seems, <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/">Ben</a> has 7.6 hours and <a href="http://simonjobling.com">Si</a> has already clocked up 15 hours. But for the most part I keep missing their no-doubt highly entertaining antics. One thing that Live misses I feel is a favourite users or previously viewed channels list. Basically I want to see which of my friends who use the service are broadcasting right now. Something like:</p>
<p><a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080213-q7ntrbip3rhwbkdbykuwt4an5.render.png" alt="Yahoo! Live Online"/></a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">API</span> request we&#8217;re interested in is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/channel.html">/channel/<span class="caps">PERMALINK</span></a> method. This lets us get information about whether the user is broadcasting at the moment.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$api = 'http://api.live.yahoo.com/api/v1/channel';
$friends = array(
  'garethr',
  'benward',
  'sijobling'
);
$statuses = array();
foreach ($friends as $friend) { 
  $response = simplexml_load_file($api . '/' . $friend);
  $name = $response-&gt;name; 
  if ($response-&gt;broadcast) {
    $status = 'live';
  } else {
    $status = 'offline';
  }
  $statuses["$name"] = $status;
}
function displaylist($array) {
  $output = '';
  if (count($array) &gt;= 0) {
    $output .= '&lt;ul&gt;';
    foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
      $output .= "&lt;li class=\"$value\"&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;a href=\"http://live.yahoo.com/$key\"&gt;";
      $output .= "$key&lt;/a&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;span&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;";
    }
    $output .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
  }
  return $output;
}
echo displaylist($statuses);
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ll add a few more people to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/">my list</a> when I discover other people using the service. If you have an account leave a comment. I&#8217;ve added a touch of javascript as well so as to avoid having to reload the page manually. This way I can loiter on my little aggregator until someone I know starts broadcasting and head over to Live for whatever Si has been spending 15 hours doing.</p>

        Continuous Integration for Front End Developers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>Most software developers, especially those with a grounding in Agile development methodologies, will probably be familiar with <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous Integration</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily &#8211; leading to multiple integrations per day. <strong>Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis above is mine, purely as it&#8217;s at the heart of what I&#8217;m going to ramble on about. A little closer to home <a href="http://theryanking.com">Ryan King</a> just <a href="http://theryanking.com/entries/2008/02/02/inursite/">posted about</a> a new site; <a href="http://inursite.com/">inursite</a>. The premise is simple; enter a few of your sites and <em>inursite</em> will visit them once a day and run a markup validation service over the page. You then get a feed of the pass or failure status. It&#8217;s simple but brilliant. For example, I have this very site added to the service. If I put some invalid markup in this post, tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll get an item in my feedreader telling me of my mistake. I&#8217;ll get that every day until I fix the problem.</p>
<p>This green/red (pass/fail) type approach to simple tests is what I find most powerful about continuous integration systems like &#8220;Cruise Control&#8221;:&quot;:http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/. Ryan asked over on his site in one of the comments what I&#8217;d like to see, so lets see:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Has all the <span class="caps">CSS</span> been compressed using something like <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">CSSTidy</a>.</li>
	<li>Has all the javascript been compressed using something like <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/jsmin.html">JSMin</a>.</li>
	<li>Does any Javascript pass the harsh taskmaster that is <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a>.</li>
	<li>If my markup a little bloated? Maybe I could set a maximum size for the markup and get a fail is I go over that.</li>
	<li>Ditto <span class="caps">CSS</span> file size.</li>
	<li>Ditt Javascript.</li>
	<li>Ditto images.</li>
	<li>If pages have associated feeds, then validate them as well according to the relevant specification (probably <span class="caps">RSS</span> or Atom).</li>
	<li>How many <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Requests does it take to load the whole page, including all the relevant assets. <ins>I&#8217;d like to be able to set a maximum number.</ins></li>
	<li>How many hosts are required to load the whole page? I&#8217;d like to be able to set a maximum number and get a fail if I go over that.</li>
	<li>Is the page gzipped on the server.</li>
	<li>And just to keep this topical, does the page have either the IE8 meta element or the associated <span class="caps">HTTP</span> header set to a particular value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of this is front-end best practice, some coming from the <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">exceptional performance</a> work. It&#8217;s something <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/minification-a-christmas-diet">I&#8217;ve touched on before</a> too. Can anyone else think of other things you&#8217;d like to see when you&#8217;re working away crafting markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span>? Once you have all these tests running you could display them in widgets, gadgets, twitter, firefox extensions, large displays, mobile devices, the works.</p>
<p>Now that sounds like an awful lot of stuff for one person (or even for one application) but I have something else in mind. If <em>inursite</em> allowed you to hook up external webservices which accept a <span class="caps">URL</span> as an argument, along with any service specific parameters, and return true or false then, in theory, anyone could add their own custom checks to it. This becomes particularly useful for larger teams than are likely to have internal quality tools already. On top of all that I&#8217;d probably pay for a service like this that let me run it on demand (rather than once per day) &#8211; or maybe even better, pay for a downloadable version (a.l.a. <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a>) I can install locally.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I think the general idea of continuous integration for front end web developer is one for which time has come. It&#8217;s simply part of our discipline growing up and becoming more professional. Whether Ryan looks to extend his fantastic simple service in this direction or not I hope something will come along that does all this and more. I might even work on it myself &#8211; but then I always say that!</p>

      <a href="/2008/01/30/simple-deployment-with-svn-and-phing/">
        Simple deployment with SVN and Phing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>Another approach to deploying web apps is to use <a href="http://phing.info/">Phing</a>. Phing is at heart a <span class="caps">PHP</span> clone of Ant,  another common build and deployment tool. The main advantage of using Phing, at least if you&#8217;re already using <span class="caps">PHP</span>, is close integration with other <span class="caps">PHP</span> specific tools (PHPDocumentor, PHPLint and PHPUnit to name a few) and ease of install.</p>
<p>Speaking to installation Phing has it&#8217;s own <span class="caps">PEAR</span> channel. I still think <span class="caps">PEAR</span> is great in so many different ways &#8211; it always makes me frown when I see people cussing at <span class="caps">PEAR</span> (especiallly the installer). You can install Phing as follows.</p>
<pre><code>pear channel-discover pear.phing.info
pear install phing/phing</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="http://phing.info/docs/guide/current/">Phing documentation</a> is nothing if not comprehensive. Unfortunately, unless you are pretty familiar with Ant or you&#8217;re trying to do something complex (and willing to invest the time) the chances are you&#8217;ll be a little lost. More and simpler examples for common problems would be useful for those beginners.</p>
<p>I might publish a few little recipes down the line or even a full commented production recipe but for the moment lets start simple. The following build script is designed to be run on your remote web server and relies on a subversion repository (hopefully you&#8217;re using source control, if not that&#8217;s another post I&#8217;m afraid). It simply exports the specified repository to the specified export directory on the server. Note that you need to set your own <span class="caps">SVN</span> details and replace the capitalised properly values. The following should be saved as <em>build.xml</em> on your web server, outside the web root.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;project name="build" default="main"&gt;
  
  &lt;property name="exportdir"  value="WEB_ROOT" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="svnpath" value="YOUR_SVNPATH" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="username" value="YOUR_SVN_USERNAME" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="password" value="YOUR_SVN_PASSWORD" /&gt;
  &lt;property name="repo" value="YOUR_SVN_REPO" /&gt;
        
  &lt;target name="main" depends="svnexport"/&gt;
  
  &lt;target name="svnexport"&gt;
    &lt;svnexport
       svnpath="${svnpath}"
       username="${username}"
       password="${password}"
       nocache="true"
       repositoryurl="${repo}"
       todir="${exportdir}"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Let&#8217;s break some of that down. Property definitions allow you to specify variables for use in your build script. In this example we only have one task specified so maybe we don&#8217;t need the extra abstraction but the moment we start reusing scripts or adding more tasks it&#8217;s a good idea.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;property name="exportdir"  value="./web" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The other major point of interest is the task itself. Here we make use of the properties we have already specified to run a subversion export. The <em>svnexport</em> task is build in to Phing.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;target name="svnexport"&gt;
  &lt;svnexport
     svnpath="${svnpath}"
     username="${username}"
     password="${password}"
     nocache="true"
     repositoryurl="${repo}"
     todir="${exportdir}"/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Also of note is the setting of a default task, <em>main</em>, as a property of the project element and specifying that the main task depends on another task, <em>svnexport</em>. Again, we could avoid that at this stage but the moment we add another few tasks then we&#8217;ll want more control over execution order.</p>
<p>Phing should be run from the directory containing the build script. You can run the command without any arguments, in which case the default task will be run (in our case <em>main</em>) or you can pass an argument to specify a specific task. For our simple build script  the two following commands do the same thing:</p>
<pre><code>phing</code></pre>

<pre><code>phing svnexport</code></pre>
<p>Given the above build script simple runs a subversion export command you might be wondering what use it is. The answer is not much at this stage. You <em>do</em> get a simple build script which can be stored in your source control system and used by the whole team. The real advantage is where you might go from here. If everyone in your team deploys in the same way (ie. using the build script) then anyone can add extra tasks and everyone gets the benefit. Simple example might be generating code documentation, running Unit tests (and not running the export if the tests fail) and creating a zip file of the deployed source for backup purposes.</p>
<p>Build scripts can get complicated quickly, but if you start out small and add tasks as you need and understand them, you should be able to raise the quality of your application and avoid easy to make mistakes.</p>
