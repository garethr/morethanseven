  <h1 class="post-title">Working For Freeagent</h1>
  <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2010</span>
  <p>So, I&#8217;ve just accepted a new job at <a href="http://freeagentcentral.com">FreeAgent</a>, the rather snappy online small business accounting startup. I&#8217;ll be starting in about a month, when I get back from devopsdays in Hamburg.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m joining a pretty well knit group of designers and developers working on a pretty well loved piece of software. I&#8217;ve known Roan (one of the directors) for years, ever since the first Highland Fling conference I think. And the rest of the team seem a good mix of technical smarts and professionalism. Hopefully I can live up to their already high standards.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to jumping into a decent sized Ruby project and getting properly reacquainted with Rails as well. I&#8217;ve spent most of the previous few years in the Python world so that should be a nice challenge. I&#8217;m constantly impressed with the number of high quality tools written in Ruby andRails 3 looks a genuinely nice piece of software. Hopefully with a bit more idiomatic ruby under my belt, more time on my hands and some new real world problems to solve I&#8217;ll increase my open source contributions and get back to writing again as well. I&#8217;ll likely be spending most of my time on those good developer staples new feature development, supporting existing code and scaling systems. I&#8217;ll also be involved in some operations stuff if I get chance, introducing software I&#8217;m a huge fan of and automating everything I can get my hands on.</p>
<p>The rest of the team are based up in Edinburgh but I&#8217;ll be working from home most of the time. I&#8217;m quite looking forward to working from Cambridge after having lived here for a few years. I&#8217;ll also get to see various friends in Edinburgh that I don&#8217;t get chance to meet up with very often and still have time to make it to London for the odd event or get together. I&#8217;ll likely be looking into coworking spaces or desk shares in and around Cambridge so if anyone has any recommendations.</p>
<p>Given this weeks pubstandards is apparently all about weddings, birthdays and new jobs (and I have all 3 within a month) it would be rude not to go along for at least one drink. If you&#8217;re around London I might see you there.</p>
