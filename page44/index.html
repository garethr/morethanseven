        Testing Websites with Twill
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">Twill</a> a little recently. It&#8217;s a Python based <span class="caps">DSL</span> used for functional testing of websites. From the official website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Twill is a simple language that allows users to browse the Web from a command-line interface. With twill, you can navigate through Web sites that use forms, cookies, and most standard Web features.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple example might make things clearer. You&#8217;ll need to install twill first &#8211; the instructions are available on <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">the site</a>. We can write tests directly into the shell so we&#8217;ll start their. For our first test we&#8217;ll write one that will hopefully fail &#8211; a test to check whether this website is down.</p>
<pre><code>twill-sh
&gt;&gt; go http://morethanseven.net
&gt;&gt; code 404</code></pre>
<p>First we fire up the twill shell then enter two simple commands. The first command, <em>go</em>, sends the browser to the specified <span class="caps">URL</span>. The second command is an assertion, in this case a check on the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status code. If this website is available then it should return the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> code 200, if it&#8217;s unavailable then it will probably return a 404 Not Found. This test will hopefully fail, indicating that this website is up and running. In reality you&#8217;re more likely to test for the 200 status code and fail on anything else but for this example it&#8217;s useful to see what a failing test looks like.</p>
<p>Although pretty powerful the twill scripting language is nice and small. I&#8217;ve listed most of the commands below just to give you an idea of the sort of things that you can get up to. You can type <em>help</em> at the twill shell to get more information on the available commands and the individual commands themselves.</p>
<ul>
	<li>twill-sh</li>
	<li>twill-sh {filename}</li>
	<li>twill-sh {filename1} {filename2}</li>
	<li>twill-sh -u {url} {filename}</li>
	<li>twill-sh -n {filename}</li>
	<li>go {url}</li>
	<li>show</li>
	<li>save_html {file-name}</li>
	<li>showlinks</li>
	<li>showforms</li>
	<li>follow {url|url-name}</li>
	<li>back</li>
	<li>reload</li>
	<li>showhistory</li>
	<li>echo {variable}</li>
	<li>formvalue {form} {input} {value}</li>
	<li>submit {input}</li>
	<li>show_cookies</li>
	<li>save_cookies {file-name}</li>
	<li>load_cookies {file-name}</li>
	<li>clear_cookies</li>
	<li>code {code}</li>
	<li>url {text}</li>
	<li>title {text}</li>
	<li>find {text}</li>
	<li>setglobal {name} {value}</li>
	<li>setlocal {name} {value}</li>
	<li>debug http 1</li>
	<li>redirect_output {file}</li>
	<li>redirect_error {file}</li>
	<li>agent {ie5|ie55|ie6|opera7|konq32|saf11|aol9}</li>
	<li>add_auth {realm} {url} {user} {password}</li>
	<li>runfile {file-name}</li>
	<li>extend_with check_links</li>
	<li>check_links</li>
	<li>check_links {regex}</li>
	<li>twill-fork -n {number} -p {processes} {script}</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also store tests in individual files as well as run a batch of tests at once. I have a couple of tests that I can run against any <span class="caps">URL</span> which might be a useful starting point for anyone else starting to look at testing their sites or applications. You can <a href="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/downloads/twill/twill.zip">download these tests here</a>.</p>
<p>If you unpack the zip archive and then open the folder in a terminal or console. You can then run all of the tests like so, note we&#8217;re passing the starting <span class="caps">URL</span> into the scripts which makes using the same scripts for multiple sites easier.</p>
<pre><code>twill-sh * -u http://morethanseven.net</code></pre>
<p>The tests included do a few things; from checking for the presence of several required markup elements and checking for an <span class="caps">XHTML</span> doctype to checking that all the links on the page are working.</p>
<p>All these examples are pretty simple and non-site-specific. For more complex form based applications you can write application browsers which fill out forms, create user sessions and do everything a user might do. Twill is also particularly useful when it comes to testing RESTful webservices with all the URLs and <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status codes floating about.</p>

        Own your endpoints
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>If <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/02/urls-are-people-too.html">URLs are people too</a> then you better make sure you control your URLs.</p>
<p>Although some people use blog hosting services like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> the majority of serious bloggers, web designers or companies generally use their own domain name to host their site. Controlling your own domain name is increasingly important when that <span class="caps">URL</span> is a representation of you on the internet.</p>
<p>With all these social networks we&#8217;re starting to have pieces of us scattered all over the place. I&#8217;ve joked previously about the utility of domain names over real names for interpersonal communication but this breaks down a little when not all the urls that represent me are owned by me. I control morethanseven.net/photos but I only have some influence over <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/garethr">flickr.com/photos/garethr</a>. With external hosts you also need to be aware of cybersquatting. I own morethanseven.net so no one else can use it. However with services that give you your own <span class="caps">URL</span> as part of registration everywhere people can cybersquat in hundreds of new domains that you might not even know about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just web pages you have to worry about. Feeds are another example of URLs you just might want to keep control over. This last one is also something I see lots of people handing off to others &#8211; specifically <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>. Now I&#8217;m a big fan of feedburner and use it for the feeds on this site. But I don&#8217;t use the feedburner <span class="caps">URL</span>, anyone subscribing to the feeds here does so using morethanseven.net/feed/. If I decide to stop using feedburner I can, without having to upset the few people who subscribe to it by moving my feed address. It&#8217;s the same with email addresses; I love gmail but rarely actually give my gmail email address out.</p>
<p>So, start looking after your domain names a little more carefully. They are pieces of you scattered around the internet, and losing control of them is going to become increasingly socially painful.</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>So, while sat with a few people at the WaSP panel at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> (of which more later when I&#8217;m fully caught up) I got a nice email from the folks at <a href="http://2008.xtech.org">Xtech</a> accepting my presentation idea. The abstract is below. If any of that sounds interesting or up your street I&#8217;d love to hear other peoples experiences or ideas on the subject.</p>
<h2>Design Strategies for a Distributed Web</h2>
<h3>From language frameworks to APIs</h3>
<p>Everyone is making use of mature and stable web application or javascript frameworks these days. That means weâ€™ve stopped reinventing things such as routing and object relational mapping, but weâ€™re all still building very similar components again and again. Frameworks might allow us to solve lots of fine grained problems but APIs could let us solve common course grained problems quicker.</p>
<h3>Building blocks for your applications</h3>
<p>Their are already a few examples in the wild of APIs designed to be used as part of your application development process. Amazon has been leading the way in providing remote services such as S3, EC2 and SimpleDB. Their are also options when it comes to hosting these services yourself, the mint analytics software and the CouchDb database service are both good examples.</p>
<h3>Quality engineering for free</h3>
<p>The real value of outsourcing a discreet portion of your application to a third party <span class="caps">API</span> lies in quality. You could always use local storage and your programming language of choice to deal with a large volume of file read and write operations. But do you really think youâ€™ll beat Amazon for reliability, scalability and speed?</p>
<h3>Functionality vs Data</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s not just high quality functionality that we could leverage from other providers. Weâ€™re all fed up with entering and re-entering our personal data into each new service. With advancements like OAuth and Microformats and lots of focus on data portability at the moment we might just be able to share data too.</p>
<h3>Change the client as well as the server</h3>
<p>Sometimes itâ€™s not enough to just change the server. The rise of specialised browsers such as Joost and Songbird allows for functionality that would be impossible otherwise. Site specific browser, along with advancements such as local storage, may prove<br />
Problems</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not all in place just yet. The reliability of your application is likely to be important, and making use of a distributed set of APIs could leave you in the unenviable position of being less stable than your least stable partner. The issue of lock-in could also raise itâ€™s head, without a vibrant ecosystem of different providers that is.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>The use of third party commercial APIs has the potential to change the development landscape â€“ bringing high quality middleware to the web. It could be the original web services dream realised. But without critical mass and an active market it could also be a new achilles heel for successful startups.</p>

        Generating Charts using Google Charts API
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>I had need recently to produce some nice looking charts and immediately turned to the very nice <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts <span class="caps">API</span></a>. Just before Christmas <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> had written up <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/tracking-christmas-cheer-with-google-charts">a great introduction</a> on <a href="http://24ways.org">24ways</a> and ever since I&#8217;d been looking for an excuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">Chris</a> wrote up a pretty nice approach to <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/01/08/generating-charts-from-accessible-data-tables-using-the-google-charts-api/">enhancing well marked up data tables</a> using the Charts <span class="caps">API</span> with a dash of Javascript and I decided to start with that. I made only a couple of changes to this approach based on personal requirements and preferences.</p>
<p>For a table like this:</p>
<table class="tochart">
  <caption>Caption</caption>  
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I prefer to use the table header element to mark up the table row and the original script relied on these being <em>td</em> elements. A couple of changes to the javascript fixed that. I also decided to display the <em>caption</em> as a title on the resulting graph.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table class="tochart"&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Data&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Data&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The original script only supported the 3D pie charts and in a couple of cases I wanted to generate bar-charts from the data or flat pie-charts. A few modifications later and you can pass a type parameter into the script via a class on the table.</p>
<p>The default if the parameter isn&#8217;t set is the flat pie-chart, which can also be specified via:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For the 3D pie-chart:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep3"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The horizontal bar-chart is created with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebhg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And finally the vertical bar-chart is set based on:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebvg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The complete modified version of Chris&#8217; script is below:</p>
<pre><code>(table2graph = function(){

  /* variables */
  var triggerClass = 'tochart';
  var chartClass = 'fromtable';
  var hideClass = 'hidden';
  var chartColor = 'FFCC33';
  var chartSize = '900x300';
  var chartType = 'p';
  
  var toTableClass = 'totable';
  var tableClass = 'generatedfromchart';
  /* end variables */

  var tables = document.getElementsByTagName('table');
  var sizeCheck = /\s?size([^\s]+)/;
  var colCheck = /\s?color([^\s]+)/;
  var typeCheck = /\s?type([^\s]+)/;
  for(var i=0;tables[i];i++){
    var t = tables[i];
    var c = t.className;
    var data = [];
    var labels = []
    if(c.indexOf(triggerClass) !== -1){
      var size = sizeCheck.exec(c);
      size = size ? size[1] : chartSize;
      var col = colCheck.exec(c);
      col = col ? col[1] : chartColor;
      var type = typeCheck.exec(c);
      type = type ? type[1] : chartType;
      
      if (type == 'bhg') {
        var label = 'chxl=1:|';
      } else {
       var label = 'chl=';
      }
      
      var caption = t.getElementsByTagName('caption')[0].innerHTML;
      var charturl = 'http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=' + type + '&amp;chtt=' + caption + '&amp;chxt=x,y&amp;chco=' + col + '&amp;chs=' + size + '&amp;chd=t:';
      t.className += ' '+ hideClass;
      var ths = t.getElementsByTagName('tbody')[0].getElementsByTagName('th');
      var tds = t.getElementsByTagName('tbody')[0].getElementsByTagName('td');
      for(var j=0;tds[j];j+=1){
        labels.push(ths[j].getElementsByTagName('em')[0].innerHTML.toLowerCase());
        data.push(tds[j].innerHTML);
      };
      var chart = document.createElement('img');
      chart.setAttribute('src',charturl+data.join(',') + '&amp;' + label + labels.join('|'));
      chart.setAttribute('alt',t.getAttribute('summary'));
      chart.className = chartClass;
      t.parentNode.insertBefore(chart,t);
    };
  };
  
  /* convert charts to tables */
  var charts = document.getElementsByTagName('img');
  for(var i=0;charts[i];i++){
    if(charts[i].className.indexOf(toTableClass) !== -1){
      var t = document.createElement('table');
      var tbody = document.createElement('tbody');
      var data = charts[i].getAttribute('src');
      var th,td,tr;
      var values = data.match(/chd=t:([^&amp;]+)&amp;?/)[1];

        Thinking Digital
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m starting to get excited about <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a>. But first a bit of back-story.</p>
<p>I started out making the trip to <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk/">@media 2005</a> and since then have been a regular attendee of more conferences than I can shake a stick at. Lets say I caught the conference bug. But most of those have been within the web standards community niche and more recently I&#8217;ve been looking further afield for conference kicks, party due to the eclectic nature of <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> style events. Anyone in that positions inevitably takes a fancy to going along to <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="caps">TED</span></a>. The <em>only</em> problem is the fact it&#8217;s already booked up until 2010, costs $6,000 just to for a standard membership and is invite only.</p>
<p>This year the folks over at <a href="http://codeworks.net">Codeworks</a>, which is a regional body set up to help us North East digital folk develop an industry, are organising their very own full size conference. The <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> events have been running for a number of years and I&#8217;ve spoken a few times on web related bits and pieces. But these are purposely local events mainly for members and tend to crop up at the rate of once a month. <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a> is a full size, 400 person, conference being held in Newcastle between the 21st and 23rd of May this year covering a similar set of wide ranging themes to <span class="caps">TED</span>; technology, design, mobile plus a bit of philosophy and futurism thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Now this is good for a few reasons. Only one of which is I can see the venue out of my apartment window. Costing only Â£475 and being in the UK would be a couple of other reasons to get excited. As an aside; I&#8217;m helping out as a board member along with the likes of <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/">Ian Forrester</a> but I&#8217;d gladly pay my way if I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The real reason for the excitement though is the calibre of some of the speakers. Ray Kurzweil, Greg Dyke, Dan Lyons (a.k.a. Fake Steve Jobs), Matt Locke, Aubrey De Grey and Tara Hunt to name a few I&#8217;m particularly interested in. And remember folks, this is in Newcastle. Which for the few Londoners reading is a couple of hours North of you. On a train with free wifi even.</p>
<p>Now this might not be a web conference but I&#8217;m pretty interested in the take of the likes of Ray Kurzweil on the web and what will happen in the near future. I&#8217;m also interested in the types of people who will make the trip &#8211; which is really the reason for this post. As everyone knows, one of the best parts of any conference is the chance to chat with like-minded (and not so like-minded) folks. So, who fancies coming along?</p>
