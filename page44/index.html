        Thinking Digital
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m starting to get excited about <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a>. But first a bit of back-story.</p>
<p>I started out making the trip to <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk/">@media 2005</a> and since then have been a regular attendee of more conferences than I can shake a stick at. Lets say I caught the conference bug. But most of those have been within the web standards community niche and more recently I&#8217;ve been looking further afield for conference kicks, party due to the eclectic nature of <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> style events. Anyone in that positions inevitably takes a fancy to going along to <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="caps">TED</span></a>. The <em>only</em> problem is the fact it&#8217;s already booked up until 2010, costs $6,000 just to for a standard membership and is invite only.</p>
<p>This year the folks over at <a href="http://codeworks.net">Codeworks</a>, which is a regional body set up to help us North East digital folk develop an industry, are organising their very own full size conference. The <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> events have been running for a number of years and I&#8217;ve spoken a few times on web related bits and pieces. But these are purposely local events mainly for members and tend to crop up at the rate of once a month. <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a> is a full size, 400 person, conference being held in Newcastle between the 21st and 23rd of May this year covering a similar set of wide ranging themes to <span class="caps">TED</span>; technology, design, mobile plus a bit of philosophy and futurism thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Now this is good for a few reasons. Only one of which is I can see the venue out of my apartment window. Costing only Â£475 and being in the UK would be a couple of other reasons to get excited. As an aside; I&#8217;m helping out as a board member along with the likes of <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/">Ian Forrester</a> but I&#8217;d gladly pay my way if I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The real reason for the excitement though is the calibre of some of the speakers. Ray Kurzweil, Greg Dyke, Dan Lyons (a.k.a. Fake Steve Jobs), Matt Locke, Aubrey De Grey and Tara Hunt to name a few I&#8217;m particularly interested in. And remember folks, this is in Newcastle. Which for the few Londoners reading is a couple of hours North of you. On a train with free wifi even.</p>
<p>Now this might not be a web conference but I&#8217;m pretty interested in the take of the likes of Ray Kurzweil on the web and what will happen in the near future. I&#8217;m also interested in the types of people who will make the trip &#8211; which is really the reason for this post. As everyone knows, one of the best parts of any conference is the chance to chat with like-minded (and not so like-minded) folks. So, who fancies coming along?</p>

        Sorry, but the Flickr API isn&#39;t REST
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>After <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org">SemanticCamp</a> me and <a href="http://icepop.org/">Rey</a> popped in to see <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com/">Osmosoft</a> towers. A good few interesting conversations ensued, including one about the difference between <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/02/19/mashup-or-integration/">mashups and integration</a>. All good fun basically. <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/">Simon</a> also had an <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/2008/02/21/off-the-shelf-integration-in-enterprises/">interesting take on the topic</a> as well.</p>
<p>What has all this to do with the topic of this post? Well, Simon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When compared to small RESTful APIs like flickr and twitter&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not really picking on Simon here, more that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write something on this topic for a while and this proved a good catalyst for a little rant.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"><span class="caps">API</span></a> is pretty darn cool. But it&#8217;s not RESTful in pretty much any way you want to shake a stick at it. It&#8217;s a well designed <span class="caps">RPC</span> (remote procedure call) <span class="caps">API</span>. Now even flickr get this wrong. They even have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/response.rest.html">a page</a> which confuses the issue and makes <span class="caps">REST</span> out to be a response format based on <span class="caps">XML</span>. Bad flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html">flickr states</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">REST</span> Endpoint <span class="caps">URL</span> is http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turns out to be completely against the whole RESTful principles. Lets try and explain. You can define most of what you want to do with an <span class="caps">API</span> with the use of nouns, verbs and content types. <span class="caps">REST</span> is based around limiting the set of verbs to those available in <span class="caps">HTTP</span>; for instance <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span class="caps">DELETE</span>. For any given application or <span class="caps">API</span> you&#8217;ll also specify a set of content types (representations); for instance <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">JSON</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>. All you get to play around with are the nouns, in the case of the web these are our URLs.</p>
<p>In a typical <span class="caps">RPC</span> style <span class="caps">API</span> you have one <span class="caps">URL</span> (like flickr does) which acts as the end point to which all calls are made. You then probably define a few functions which you can call. Lets look at a simple book example.</p>
<pre><code>getBook()
deleteBook()
createBook()
editBook()</code></pre>
<p>The RESTful way of designing this might look a little bit more like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET     /books/{book-id}
DELETE  /books/{book-id}
POST    /books
PUT     /books/{book-id}</code></pre>
<p>We mentioned content types or representations earlier. Lets say instead of the default response format we might want to get a <span class="caps">JSON</span> representation of a given book we might do something like the following.</p>
<pre><code>GET /books/{book-id}.json</code></pre>
<p>The advantages of using URLs as the <span class="caps">API</span> nouns in this way include more than just sane URLs for the site or application in question. The web is based around many of these architectural principles and that seemed to scale pretty well. The idea is that fell envisaged RESTful applications have an advantage here too. For me one of the real benefits of RESTful APIs are in the simplicity they bring to documentation. I already know the available verbs, all I need to know are the set of resource URLs and I can probably use <span class="caps">CURL</span> to work out the <span class="caps">REST</span> (sorry, bad pun).</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is pretty common. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">WikiPedia</a> appreciates their is a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between the uses of the term â€œRESTâ€ causes some confusion in technical discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just pedantry on my part, well not quite. I&#8217;d recommend anyone involved in designing and architecting web sites read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260">RESTful Web Services</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/">Roy Fielding&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. But if you just want to <em>get</em> the general principles and don&#8217;t fancy wading through technical documents then you have to read <a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained <span class="caps">REST</span> to My Wife</a> hilariously written by <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, just because an <span class="caps">API</span> makes use of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> doesn&#8217;t make it RESTful. I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I had a great time at <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org/">SemanticCamp</a> over the weekend which was not too much of a surprise. What was a surprise was getting back home to find out that I&#8217;ve been invited to join the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> (WaSP) on the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/edutf">Education Task Force</a>. I even have my <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/grushgrove/">own page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting me guys. Anyone who has had the misfortune of having me present during a discussion of the current state of web education knows it&#8217;s one of my favourite subjects. Hopefully I can make myself useful around the place and help with getting a few things done. More on this when I know more but in the meantime feel free to pester me endlessly if you have a particular axe to grind.</p>

        Example of the Yahoo Live Api
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Feb 2008</span>

    <p><a href="http://live.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Live</a> launched recently along with a nice <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/">RESTful <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the beauty of <span class="caps">REST</span> being in lowering the barrier to hacking and when I wanted a quick feature for Live it was simplicity itself to put together.</p>
<p>A few friends are using it far too much it seems, <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/">Ben</a> has 7.6 hours and <a href="http://simonjobling.com">Si</a> has already clocked up 15 hours. But for the most part I keep missing their no-doubt highly entertaining antics. One thing that Live misses I feel is a favourite users or previously viewed channels list. Basically I want to see which of my friends who use the service are broadcasting right now. Something like:</p>
<p><a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/"><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20080213-q7ntrbip3rhwbkdbykuwt4an5.render.png" alt="Yahoo! Live Online"/></a></p>
<p>The <span class="caps">API</span> request we&#8217;re interested in is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ylive/rest_api/channel.html">/channel/<span class="caps">PERMALINK</span></a> method. This lets us get information about whether the user is broadcasting at the moment.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php
$api = 'http://api.live.yahoo.com/api/v1/channel';
$friends = array(
  'garethr',
  'benward',
  'sijobling'
);
$statuses = array();
foreach ($friends as $friend) { 
  $response = simplexml_load_file($api . '/' . $friend);
  $name = $response-&gt;name; 
  if ($response-&gt;broadcast) {
    $status = 'live';
  } else {
    $status = 'offline';
  }
  $statuses["$name"] = $status;
}
function displaylist($array) {
  $output = '';
  if (count($array) &gt;= 0) {
    $output .= '&lt;ul&gt;';
    foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $value) {
      $output .= "&lt;li class=\"$value\"&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;a href=\"http://live.yahoo.com/$key\"&gt;";
      $output .= "$key&lt;/a&gt;";
      $output .= "&lt;span&gt;$value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;";
    }
    $output .= '&lt;/ul&gt;';
  }
  return $output;
}
echo displaylist($statuses);
?&gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ll add a few more people to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/yahoolive/">my list</a> when I discover other people using the service. If you have an account leave a comment. I&#8217;ve added a touch of javascript as well so as to avoid having to reload the page manually. This way I can loiter on my little aggregator until someone I know starts broadcasting and head over to Live for whatever Si has been spending 15 hours doing.</p>

        Continuous Integration for Front End Developers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>Most software developers, especially those with a grounding in Agile development methodologies, will probably be familiar with <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Continuous Integration</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily &#8211; leading to multiple integrations per day. <strong>Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis above is mine, purely as it&#8217;s at the heart of what I&#8217;m going to ramble on about. A little closer to home <a href="http://theryanking.com">Ryan King</a> just <a href="http://theryanking.com/entries/2008/02/02/inursite/">posted about</a> a new site; <a href="http://inursite.com/">inursite</a>. The premise is simple; enter a few of your sites and <em>inursite</em> will visit them once a day and run a markup validation service over the page. You then get a feed of the pass or failure status. It&#8217;s simple but brilliant. For example, I have this very site added to the service. If I put some invalid markup in this post, tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll get an item in my feedreader telling me of my mistake. I&#8217;ll get that every day until I fix the problem.</p>
<p>This green/red (pass/fail) type approach to simple tests is what I find most powerful about continuous integration systems like &#8220;Cruise Control&#8221;:&quot;:http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/. Ryan asked over on his site in one of the comments what I&#8217;d like to see, so lets see:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Has all the <span class="caps">CSS</span> been compressed using something like <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">CSSTidy</a>.</li>
	<li>Has all the javascript been compressed using something like <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/jsmin.html">JSMin</a>.</li>
	<li>Does any Javascript pass the harsh taskmaster that is <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a>.</li>
	<li>If my markup a little bloated? Maybe I could set a maximum size for the markup and get a fail is I go over that.</li>
	<li>Ditto <span class="caps">CSS</span> file size.</li>
	<li>Ditt Javascript.</li>
	<li>Ditto images.</li>
	<li>If pages have associated feeds, then validate them as well according to the relevant specification (probably <span class="caps">RSS</span> or Atom).</li>
	<li>How many <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Requests does it take to load the whole page, including all the relevant assets. <ins>I&#8217;d like to be able to set a maximum number.</ins></li>
	<li>How many hosts are required to load the whole page? I&#8217;d like to be able to set a maximum number and get a fail if I go over that.</li>
	<li>Is the page gzipped on the server.</li>
	<li>And just to keep this topical, does the page have either the IE8 meta element or the associated <span class="caps">HTTP</span> header set to a particular value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of this is front-end best practice, some coming from the <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/">exceptional performance</a> work. It&#8217;s something <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/minification-a-christmas-diet">I&#8217;ve touched on before</a> too. Can anyone else think of other things you&#8217;d like to see when you&#8217;re working away crafting markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span>? Once you have all these tests running you could display them in widgets, gadgets, twitter, firefox extensions, large displays, mobile devices, the works.</p>
<p>Now that sounds like an awful lot of stuff for one person (or even for one application) but I have something else in mind. If <em>inursite</em> allowed you to hook up external webservices which accept a <span class="caps">URL</span> as an argument, along with any service specific parameters, and return true or false then, in theory, anyone could add their own custom checks to it. This becomes particularly useful for larger teams than are likely to have internal quality tools already. On top of all that I&#8217;d probably pay for a service like this that let me run it on demand (rather than once per day) &#8211; or maybe even better, pay for a downloadable version (a.l.a. <a href="http://haveamint.com">Mint</a>) I can install locally.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I think the general idea of continuous integration for front end web developer is one for which time has come. It&#8217;s simply part of our discipline growing up and becoming more professional. Whether Ryan looks to extend his fantastic simple service in this direction or not I hope something will come along that does all this and more. I might even work on it myself &#8211; but then I always say that!</p>
