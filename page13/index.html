        Python On Cloudfoundry
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 May 2011</span>

    <p>For those that haven&#8217;t yet had a look <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/">Cloudfoundry</a> from VMware is two things, one of which is nice, one of which is very cool indeed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On one hand it&#8217;s a platform as a service, allowing you to easily deploy Ruby, Java and Node.js applications to <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/">cloudfoundry.com</a>.</li>
	<li>On the other hand it&#8217;s an <a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/">open source project</a> with all the code on <a href="http://github.com/cloudfoundry">Github</a> allowing you to run the entire stack wherever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty interested in the latter. Its <span class="caps">API</span> could in theory become a defacto standard for application and service buildouts, in the same way as we&#8217;re seeing the EC2 <span class="caps">API</span> expand outside <span class="caps">AWS</span> for managing infrastructure (and arguably how we&#8217;re using Chef and Puppet for managing the things installed on that infrastructure). The really interesting bit is the fact it&#8217;s all open source. Not only does that mean you can run it on your own infrastructure (including as I&#8217;m doing on a virtual machine on my laptop), but it&#8217;s also designed so new services (like Redis, MySQL, RabbitMQ), new runtimes (like Ruby 1.8, RUby 1.9, Java) and new frameworks (like Rails, Sinatra, Spring) can be added easily.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running vcap on a <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a> managed VirtualBox instance, but you could install it anywhere you like. I used <a href="https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart">these chef recipes</a> to get everything installed. I ran into an issue with the mysql service not starting correctly that <a href="https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart/pull/2">I fixed</a> and I needed to manually install chef into the rvm gemset part way through the install, but the recipes pretty much just worked.</p>
<p>Looking for an excuse to have a route through the vcap code I decided to see if I could add rudimentary support for Python applications. After a day of noodling around I&#8217;ve forked the code and sent a few pull requests back with it basically working. This required changes to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vmc/pull/18">vmc client</a>, to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/pull/57">vcap service</a> and like all good open source contributions to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-tests/pull/4">test suite</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks hugely to existing pull requests (mainly the one&#8217;s for <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/pull/25">adding <span class="caps">PHP</span> support</a>) it&#8217;s not taken long at all. The Sinatra and Rails support which shipped with the first release from VMWare supports using Bundler to define gem dependencies that can be pulled in at deploy time. It shouldn&#8217;t be too much effort I&#8217;m hoping to do the same for using pip and virtualenv for each deployed python application. I think I can also see how to support python3 and how to add django as a supported framework.</p>
<p>I had huge fun, but you might not at this early stage in the project. I&#8217;m relatively happy with reading and writing Ruby, futzing with rvm, debugging installation woes and hunting down service configuration problems. The best tool for working out what was happening was generally tailing the logs in /tmp/vcap-run/ and finding the code that wrote a given message. If you just want something to work I&#8217;d wait a little while, if you like the sound of the above it&#8217;s a pretty nice codebase to play around in. I&#8217;d love to eventually see some official contributor documentation and some hints and tips on things like running the tests. At the moment flicking through reported issues and pull requests on GitHub is the best place to start.</p>

        Vagrant Plugin For Interacting With Vagrantbox.es

    <span class="post-date">08 May 2011</span>

    <p>After <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog">Patrick</a> released <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/sahara/">Sahara</a>, a nifty extension for the <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> command line tool, I&#8217;ve been meaning to put together a similar extension for interacting with the growing list of base boxes on <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es">vagrantbox.es</a>.</p>
<p>After a bit of hacking this morning I&#8217;ve just pushed out an initial release of the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrantboxes">vagrantboxes gem</a> and you can find the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/ruby-vagrantboxes">source code and some documentation on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The extensions adds a vagrantboxes namespace to the vagrant command line tool which provides a few useful commands. Specifically you can list all the available boxes, do text searches, show the full details of a box and most handily of all add a box that takes your fancy to your local base box store, all without having to worry about the URLs of the boxes if you don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a simple search:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; vagrant vagrantboxes search centos
3    centos 5.5                http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15307300/vagrant-0.7-centos-64-base.box
6    opscode centos 5          http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/centos5-gems.box
7    opscode ubuntu 10.04      http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu10.04-gems.box
9    puppet centos 5.5 64      http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos5_64.box
10   puppet centos 4 64        http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos4_64.box
21   centos 5.6 32             http://yum.mnxsolutions.com/vagrant/centos_56_32.box</pre>
<p>And another quick example, this time of show printing the full description. In the future I might look to store more structured metadata and make this more useful.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; vagrant vagrantboxes show 18
puppet debian lenny 64
http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/debian_lenny_64.box

Debian Lucid 64 bit vagrant box. Puppet 2.6.6 installed and ready to provision using the Puppet provisioner in Vagrant.

For good sample modules, try the jeffmccune-motd and jeffmccune-mockbuild modules posted to http://forge.puppetlabs.com/

Created by Ken Barber, ken@puppetlabs.com</pre>
<p>This proved a good excuse to delve into the Vagrant source code which is pretty readable for the most part once you understand the libraries it&#8217;s build upon. It&#8217;s simple enough to extend for adding commands like this too, which bodes well for other more useful additions in the future.</p>
<p>If anyone has any problems with this extensions do let me know. Error handling currently consists of returning blank output rather than sensible error codes or messages, and as I&#8217;ve yet to add a small test suite so their might (will) be a few bugs lying around. I&#8217;ll try and make it better behaved in the next week or two but reasoned it&#8217;s useful straight away.</p>

      <a href="/2011/05/07/Version-control-and-deployment-of-cron-jobs/">
        Version Control And Deployment Of Cron Jobs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 May 2011</span>

    <p>A recent question on Twitter prompted me to write a quick blog post about managing cron jobs. As more and more people want to automate provisioning and deployment of web applications some, maybe previously manually managed, items come into the fold.</p>
<p>Cron jobs are interesting because you may prefer to see them as part of the infrastructure (like apache or mysql) or as part of your application code. I think both are valid, sometimes at the same time. For instance you might have a cron job which deals with scheduled database backups. All that requires is the database and the script to be present. At other times your cron jobs might require your entire application stack. For instance a rake task which uses a Rails application model, or a django management command.</p>
<h2>Configuration Management and Cron</h2>
<p>Both <a href="http://opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/">Puppet</a> provide a cron resource type. This is particularly handy for things like database backup scripts or ganglia gmetric scripts. You probably want these scripts and cron jobs to be installed on machines that have the related software installed, and you&#8217;re probably already describing this in your Chef recipes or Puppet manifests. If you&#8217;re not already using one of these tools using them to manage just your cron jobs is a nice way of starting out.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#cron">Puppet Cron Type</a> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>cron { command:
  command =&gt; "/usr/local/sbin/command",
  hour =&gt; 2,
  minute =&gt; 0
}</code></pre>
<p>And the equivalent <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Cron">Chef Reasource</a> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>cron "describe your job" do
  hour "2"
  minute "0"
  command "/usr/local/sbin/command"
end</code></pre>
<p>The important part is that by describing your cron jobs in code you can then version control them easily, and both Chef and Puppet have mechanisms to push these jobs out to be installed by the relevant hosts. With cron jobs you might not want all your machines to be running the same jobs for instance.</p>
<h2>Using Whenever</h2>
<p>An alternative, or complimentary, approach to versioning and deploying cron jobs would be to tie it in with your application code. This makes sense when those jobs are tightly coupled to your application, for instance rails specific rake tasks or django management commands. <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever</a> is a tool I&#8217;ve been using recently that makes this pretty simple. You describe your cron jobs in a file called schedule.rb like so:</p>
<pre><code>every 3.hours do
  command "/usr/local/sbin/command"
end</code></pre>
<p>And then running the provided whenever command line application will generate a working crontab. Whenever ships with capistrano integration and some useful shortcuts for running rake tasks or accessing Ruby code, but it&#8217;s simple to write your own command shortcuts without having to write ruby code too.</p>
<h2>Other Approaches</h2>
<p>I have seen some tools which replace cron completely, but I&#8217;ve never liked that idea much. Cron works pretty well, and is clever enough to deal with things like daylight saving time and leap years inteligently if needed. I know other folks who are centralising all regular jobs into something like Jenkins. I can see advantages to that, although I&#8217;ve yet to find a really nice way of automating this outside the gui interface or manually modifying configuration files.</p>

        Creating A Cucumber Nagios Package With Fpm
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve written <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html">before</a> about why I like System Packages, but even I&#8217;ll admit that the barriers to creating them mean I don&#8217;t use them for everything. <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm"><span class="caps">FPM</span></a> however is making it much easier, to the point where I&#8217;m starting to create a few packages I can reuse on projects. I thought a write up of how I&#8217;m doing that for <a href="http://cucumber-nagios.org/">Cucumber-Nagios</a> might be useful.</p>
<p>For those that haven&#8217;t seen it yet, <span class="caps">FPM</span> (or Effing Package Management) is a tool that helps you build packages, like RPMs and DEBs, quickly. It can take in gems, python packages, node.js npm files or just plain directories and make files and from that create you one or more system packages. Lets have a look at a full example with a Ruby gem.I really like using cucumber-nagios, whatever platform or language I happen to be using at the time. I have a number of Django projects for instance with cucumber-nagios checks, so being able to not worry about most of the Ruby install is useful.</p>
<p>In order to use <span class="caps">FPM</span> you&#8217;ll need to install it. It&#8217;s available as a Ruby gem so lets start there. I&#8217;m not going to delve into setting up a Ruby Gems environment as it&#8217;s annoying and covered for most platforms elsehere on the internet.</p>
<pre><code>gem install fpm</code></pre>
<p>First off lets install the cucumber-nagios gem, along with all it&#8217;s dependencies, into a local folder on my build machine. This might be a virtual machine or a separate machine in your cluster. It should be running the same OS as the intended production machines however. The following examples are from Ubuntu, but it&#8217;s much the same for <span class="caps">RPM</span> based distros.</p>
<pre><code>gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --install-dir ~/tmp/gems cucumber-nagios</code></pre>
<p>Cucumber-nagios has a large number of dependencies, so we&#8217;re going to need to create packages for all of those too. <span class="caps">FPM</span> will cleverly deal with maintaining the specified dependencies thought. We&#8217;ll use find to do this quickly, and then instruct <span class="caps">FPM</span> to convert from a gem to a deb. You could obviously do this line by line if you prefer.</p>
<pre><code>find ~/tmp/gems/cache -name '*.gem' | xargs -rn1 fpm -s gem -t deb -a all</code></pre>
<p>That should leave us with lots of new .deb files that we can have a closer look at:</p>
<pre><code>dpkg --info rubygem-cucumber-nagios_0.9.0_i686.deb
dpkg -c rubygem-cucumber-nagios_0.9.0_i686.deb</code></pre>
<p>If you already have a private apt repository set up then just upload these packages and away you go. I&#8217;d like to use apt for installing them so I can leave it to manage all the dependencies easily. If not then I&#8217;ll show you briefly how to create a local file system repo, it&#8217;s not much more work to create a shared repo available over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</p>
<p>First create a directory to store our packages and move our newly created .deb files into it. You&#8217;ll need to be able to execute some of these commands as root but given the topic I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ll be able to deal with that.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/repo
cp *.all.deb /usr/local/repo</code></pre>
<p>For the next part you&#8217;ll need to install the dpkg development tools, and then create a file that can be read by apt when it&#8217;s looking for packages it can install.</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install dpkg-dev
dpkg-scanpackages /usr/local/repo /dev/null | gzip -9c &gt; /usr/local/repo/Packages.gz</code></pre>
<p>Now add your new package repo to your apt sources and update your package cache.</p>
<pre><code>/etc/apt/sources.list
deb file:/usr/local/repo ./
apt-get update</code></pre>
<p>At this point everything should be up and running. Let&#8217;s do a search in our repo:</p>
<pre><code>apt-cache search rubygem-
rubygem-amqp - AMQP client implementation in Ruby/EventMachine
rubygem-builder - Builders for MarkUp.
rubygem-bundler - The best way to manage your application's dependencies
rubygem-cucumber - cucumber-0.10.2
rubygem-cucumber-nagios - Systems testing plugin for Nagios using Cucumber.
rubygem-diff-lcs - Provides a list of changes that represent the difference between two sequenced collections.

rubygem-json - JSON Implementation for Ruby
rubygem-mechanize - The Mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites
rubygem-net-ssh - Net::SSH: a pure-Ruby implementation of the SSH2 client protocol.
rubygem-nokogiri - Nokogiri (鋸) is an HTML, XML, SAX, and Reader parser
rubygem-rack - a modular Ruby webserver interface
rubygem-rack-test - Simple testing API built on Rack

rubygem-templater - Templater has the ability to both copy files from A to B and also to render templates using ERB
rubygem-term-ansicolor - Ruby library that colors strings using ANSI escape sequences
rubygem-webrat - Ruby Acceptance Testing for Web applications</code></pre>
<p>And finally lets install cucumber-nagios from our shiny new package.</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install rubygem-cucumber-nagios</code></pre>
<p>If everything has worked out you should be able to run the cucumber-nagios-gen command to create a new project. Note that the path may be different, and in the case of debian based distros the gem bin path is not on the Path.</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/bin/cucumber-nagios-gen project test

    <p>Since I launched it back in November my <a href="http://devopsweekly.com">Devops Weekly</a> email has been pretty well received I think. Folks on twitter seem to like it, as do a few people I&#8217;ve met at recent events who have said nice things. One thing a few people have been after though is an online archive, either because email just doesn&#8217;t work for them or more often because they missed out on the earlier issues.</p>
<p>With a little time this weekend and the help of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> I&#8217;ve just added the seventeen iss§ues to date to the new <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/archive">Devops Weekly archive</a>. I&#8217;d have liked to do something a bit more useful, maybe introduce per link tags or a nifty search feature, but I&#8217;m pretty busy at present and reason this should serve the main purpose of getting these links online.</p>
