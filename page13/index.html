        A Continuous Deployment Example Setup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>One of the reasons behind getting around to building <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es">Vagrantbox.es</a> recently was I was giving a talk to a group of startups on <a href="http://thedifferenceengine.eu/">The Difference Engine</a> programme and I wanted to have an example project to demonstrate various things. I wanted to demonstrate everything from sensible version control habbits, configuration management, basic orcestration and most importantly a solid deployment process. I&#8217;ve decided to write up what I&#8217;m doing for deployment because I think it&#8217;s pretty nice, and for all the talk about Continuous Deployment I haven&#8217;t seen many examples of code and configuration to make it happen.</p>
<p>Most of what I&#8217;ll cover is pretty easy to map to whatever technologies your using. For this project I&#8217;d gone for Git, Django, Gunicorn, Nginx, Fabric, Mysql and Jenkins and I&#8217;m deploying to Ubuntu running on <a href="http://www.brightbox.co.uk/">Brightbox Cloud</a>. Apart from the Jenkins instance in the middle you could follow the instructions and swap things out easily.</p>
<h2>Jenkins</h2>
<p>First up lets install <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>. I setup a separate cloud instance just to run the Continuous Integration server. I find this approach easier to manage but you could always run this locally if you prefer. The Jenkins folk provide very up to date <a href="http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/">packages for Debian</a> so I chose to use those.</p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>Jenkins provides a huge number of optional plugins which enable various additional features. Plugins are installed via the web interface at /pluginManager. I&#8217;ve installed:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin">Jenkins Cobertura Plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Jenkins <span class="caps">GIT</span> plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin">GitHub plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Green+Balls">Green Balls</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations">Hudson Violations plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Git plugin is really required for what I&#8217;m doing with deployment. Cobertura and Violations are code quality metrics tools that I use to record output from pylint and code coverage for my test suite.</p>
<h2>The Source</h2>
<p>My finished project was already on GitHub in a private repository. I&#8217;m using a requirements.txt file to record python dependencies so I can use pip to install them automatically and I&#8217;m using Virtualenv to sandbox this installation. I&#8217;m also using South to manage my database schema changes. I won&#8217;t go into that here as it&#8217;s pretty Python specific, Rails for instance has Active Record migrations, <span class="caps">RVM</span> and Bundler which do pretty much the same job. <span class="caps">PHP</span> has <span class="caps">PEAR</span> and some of the frameworks offer a migration tool.</p>
<p>I then created two projects in Jenkins:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiRywEM" alt="Jenkins dashboard"/></p>
<h3>Project 1: Vagrantboxes</h3>
<p>This is the main build of my master branch in Git. As well as setting up the Git repo as shown below I&#8217;ve set a polling schedule to */5 * * * * (that&#8217;s every 5 minutes) and also set Trigger builds remotely so I can have a task in my fabfile which triggers a build immediately.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjh2gEM" alt="Git config for Jenkins"/></p>
<p>I then have two build steps, both of which execute shell commands. The first installs any new requirements via pip:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "source bin/activate; pip install -r requirements.txt"</pre>
<p>The second runs my test suite and generates the <span class="caps">XML</span> output required to show the test results in Jenkins:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "source bin/activate; cd vagrantboxes/configs/common; python manage.py jenkins boxes"</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m using the rather handy <a href="https://github.com/kmmbvnr/django-jenkins">Django Jenkins</a> application for this.</p>
<p>So far so good. This gives us a project that, when we push some changes to GitHub, will pull those changes down to the CI server and run our test suite, giving us feedback as to whether the tests pass or fail.</p>
<p>Now for the trick, in Post-build Actions tick Build other projects and specify the name of another project that we&#8217;ll setup next. Mine is called Vagrantboxes-deploy.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRirwwEM" alt="Post build action in Jenkins"/></p>
<h3>Project 2: Vagrantboxes-deploy</h3>
<p>This project is triggered only when the previous project runs successfully. And all it&#8217;s going to do is run the deployment script on the project we just built. The setup for this project is very simply, it has one build step which just executes the following:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "cd /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Vagrantboxes/workspace; source bin/activate; fab appserver deploy"</pre>
<p>The specifics of the Fabric script here aren&#8217;t that important but I&#8217;m doing something not too disimilar to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/07/27/fabric-django-git-apache-mod_wsgi-virtualenv-and-p.html">what I described here</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;ve setup a separate project for these is so I can, if I choose, trigger a deployment separately to the full build, and also so I can very easily disable deployments even if the main build is still running.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>With this setup whenever I push code to master it triggers a build. If the test suite passes it runs the deployment script and pushes out the code to the live web servers. This suites me and this project but you might find it easier to start by pushing all successfull builds out to a staging environment. And maybe then moving on to having a new project which is only triggered manually for deploying to production.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiqwwEM" alt="project view in Jenkins"/></p>
<p>This setup has other advantages too. The Jenkins dashboard becomes a handy tool for recording deployment events. You can easily setup emails or IM messages or Campfire posts to alert other team members whenever a deployment happens. And it really really makes sure your delployment scripts work without hand holding.</p>
<p>This is a simple project that I&#8217;m working on on my own, but in a team environment you&#8217;d likely have a more complex branching strategy and more Jenkins projects. You might also introduce some gateways for manual testing but the starting point is the same. Jenkins makes archiving successful build artifacts relatively easy as well, this setup has a few race condition possibilities that you can fix by building artifacts from successful builds. Jenkins also supports building from different branches and having different branches trigger different projects, all handy if you want to grow this kind of setup.</p>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>A brief <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/garethr/status/40785392445685760">conversation with Matt Keating</a> on Twitter finally pushed me over the edge and I&#8217;ve built a site I&#8217;d been meaning to do for a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> fan, but one thing that often comes up is where to find base boxes. My newly launched site <a href="http://vagrantbox.es">Vagranbox.es</a> provides just that. At the moment that just means user submitted boxes being checked and then posted. I&#8217;ll likely add comments and ratings and the like if things become popular but that&#8217;s for later.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjBuwEM" alt="vargrantbox.es homepage"/></p>
<p>So, if you know of or host a useful box please let me know. I&#8217;ll try to keep up with any submissions.</p>

        Devops - More Than Marketing - Talk By James Turnbull
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just found my notes from <a href="http://kartar.net">James Turnbull&#8217;s</a> talk at <a href="http://fosdem.org"><span class="caps">FOSDEM</span></a>. I found the talk excellent, and I&#8217;m already part of the choir. But much of the audience I&#8217;d guess have only come across the devops term in passing, or worse had it pushed at them as part of marketing materials. Hopefully I captured the main points:</p>
<h2>So what is devops all about?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cooperation (between development and operations teams)</li>
	<li>Buzzword bingo?</li>
	<li>Pop culture movement?</li>
	<li>Discussion</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s early days</li>
	<li>No one has all the answers</li>
	<li>Nothing is fixed in stone</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s all about outreach</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s about</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Simplicity &#8211; Repeatable, Reusable, Easy to communicate</li>
	<li>Relationships &#8211; Engage early, engage often, &#8220;Toss it over the fence&#8221;, Talk to people</li>
	<li>Process &#8211; Test everything, Automate everything, Redundancy and expectation of failure, Transparent and open to everyone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Not just ops tools &#8211; Config mnagement, Deployment and orchestration, Monitoring, Security, Testing</li>
	<li>Use for entire lifecycle dev &#8594; test &#8594; ops</li>
	<li>Not just dev tools &#8211; Version control, Agile, Application architecture</li>
	<li>Testing methodology &#8211; Low level vs functional</li>
	<li>Documentation &#8211; &#8220;The only time the network diagram is up to date is after the post mortem&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Continuous improvement</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Nothing stands still &#8211; Customers, Products, Technology, Your team</li>
	<li>Strike often, striek hard, be aggressive</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s a culture change</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is Hard</li>
	<li>People hate change</li>
	<li>People hate people who introduce change</li>
	<li>Fear of change is irrational &#8211; Listen, Concrete examples</li>
	<li>Make developers resonsible for uptime &#8211; Pagers</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">FUD</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always done this&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;That can&#8217;t work here&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;This is all about one group or another&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;You&#8217;re an elitist bunch of Europeans&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dangers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Marketing speak</li>
	<li>Lip service</li>
	<li>Disenchantment</li>
	<li>Disenfranchisement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;Not about a person, or a team. About changing how your operations team works&#8221;</li>
	<li>Automate away small boring repetative tasks to make time for interesting activities</li>
	<li>Embed ops people into dev teams</li>
	<li>Drag devs to ops standups</li>
	<li>Build shared appreciation</li>
	<li>Metrics conversations are really powerful</li>
</ul>

    <p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/">Fosdem</a> last weekend to a packed <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/configuration_systems_management_devroom">Configuration amd systems management devroom</a>.</p>
<p>My presentation covered some of the same ground as recent blog posts, namely why you should be using virtualisation and config management tools to manage your local development environment.</p>

<p>People even said <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unixdaemon/status/34209307390124033">nice things</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@garethr basically has this subject completely covered. He&#8217;s even advocating the correct editor. excellent #fosdem talk</p>

<p>All in all another good event, I have notes about some of the other talks I went along to that I&#8217;ll try write up soon.</p>

        Using Checkinstall With Virtualenv For Python Deployments
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>Michael Brunton-Spall wrote last week about some <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2011/01/26/packaging-and-deploying-python-web-apps/">frustrations with packagings and deploying Python web applications</a>. Although his experience was with Python, the problems he describes are the same for Ruby and <span class="caps">PHP</span> and a whole host of languages. The following example uses Python, but works equally as well for anything else.</p>
<p>Michael has three simple rules for his servers:</p>
<ol>
	<li>they cannot access the internet</li>
	<li>they cannot access internal services that are for development</li>
	<li>they cannot have compilers / utilities on them</li>
</ol>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into all the reasons for doing this (you can read the blog post linked to above) but these are pretty sensible security precautions.</p>
<p>My approach to this problem would be to use your friendly system packages and using a handy tool called <a href="http://www.asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/">Checkinstall</a> to create a deb or rpm. I&#8217;m going to use as an example the <a href="http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Eventlet">Eventlet</a> library. This is available in PyPi and one of it&#8217;s dependencies (Greenlets) provides a C extension. The same approach would work for an entire Python web application too. I&#8217;m as ever using the apt package management tool but this should work with yum as well.</p>
<p>The first step is to build the package on a build machine. This should be a machine or virtual machine running the same operating system as your production web servers. You might build these packages manually or as part of a continuous integration system. On this machine we&#8217;ll need the compilers and development tools:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-setuptools checkinstall
sudo easy_install virtualenv</pre>
<p>We&#8217;ll also create a virtualenv into which we&#8217;ll be installing our packages:</p>
<pre>sudo virtualenv --no-site-packages /usr/local/environment
source /usr/local/environment/bin/activate</pre>
<p>Now, instead of just calling easy_install to install the package, we prefix it with checkinstall.</p>
<pre>sudo checkinstall /usr/local/environment/bin/easy_install eventlet</pre>
<p>This will prompt for various meta data about the package you want to create, including the name and version of the package. If you&#8217;re using this method in the real world you&#8217;ll want to decide on a versioning and naming scheme for your packages to avoid clashes with system provided packages. You can also set many of these options from the command line rather than having to manually fill them in each time.</p>
<p>Once everything has been filled in successfully this should run through, installing eventlet and greenlets and eventually creating a deb or rpm package depending on what platform you&#8217;re running on. You should see something like:</p>
<pre>Done. The new package has been installed and saved to

 /home/vagrant/eventlet-gareth_20110129-1_i386.deb

 You can remove it from your system anytime using: 

      dpkg -r eventlet-gareth</pre>
<p>Now lets grab that package and take it to one of our front end web servers via a controlled deployment process. That front end web server needs the virtualenv creating but nothing else. So:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
sudo virtualenv --no-site-packages /usr/local/environment</pre>
<p>(Now you might be thinking that installing the python-virtualenv package in this way breaks rule 1 above. And you&#8217;d be right in most cases, but I&#8217;m guessing Michael&#8217;s systems team have a local package repo for authorised packages, or alternatively you could download the package to the build machine and push it to the production environment.)</p>
<p>Now install the package we created earlier.</p>
<pre>sudo dpkg -i eventlet-gareth_20110129-1_i386.deb</pre>
<p>That should throw all the required files into the virtualenv environment we created. No compilers. No calls to internal or external systems. Just move some precompiled binaries and text files to predefined places on disk.</p>
<p>I used a PyPi package as an example. Checkinstall could have been pointed at a custom build file written especially for your own application, one that moves files and folders to where they are needed. Say something that looks like this:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/sh
cp /home/stage/myapplication /var/www/apps/</pre>
<p>The running checkinstall against that (or a more complex build file using capistrano or ant or fabric) you can create a package containing your application code and install it into the specified place.</p>
