    <p>Ok, so I&#8217;ve been shopping again but I&#8217;ll try and make this post a little more useful that <em>oh, look at my shiny new toy</em>.</p>
<p>I decided that what I was really missing to help with my <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> addiction and growing interest in the mobile web was a shiny new Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgN800.jpg" title="Nokia N800 Internet Tablet" alt="Nokia N800 Internet Tablet" /></p>
<p>I cant really write a fair review at the moment as I&#8217;ve only just got my mits on it so that will have to save for later. All I can think at the moment is <em>&#8220;Oh, shiny&#8221;</em>. What I will do is list the software I installed on it from the start, partly to demonstrate what you can get on it, partly to link to thinks I found useful and mostly to remind me if and when I need to do it again.</p>

        Even More Events
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>I occasionally get some stick for wandering the country attending as many web related get togethers as I can manage but in fairness their are so many good events to get along to at the moment it would be rude not to. So here&#8217;s yet another run down of some upcoming events that people really should try and get along to:</p>
<h3>The Highland Fling</h3>
<p>Yes! It&#8217;s <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">The Highland Fling</a> in only a couple of weeks and it&#8217;s still looking as great as when I bought my tickets. A nice, small, event with a host of good speakers (and good guys) and it&#8217;s not south of me for the first time ever. Props to <a href="http://www.alanwhitewebdevelopment.com/">Alan</a> for getting this off the ground.</p>
<h3>Refresh Edinburgh</h3>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enought it&#8217;s worth staying around an extra day in Edinburgh for a Refresh get together. Again a good lineup of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/refresh-edinburgh/browse_thread/thread/be872d4891580ee4">speakers</a> and I would imagine a much interesting discussion and debate.</p>
<h3>BarCamp NorthEast</h3>
<p>With all the <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> goings on around <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp London</a> lots of other UK BarCamps have started to get organised, including one around <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">these parts</a>. Heather, <a href="http://www.agm.me.uk/blog">Alistair</a>, <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com/">Meri</a> and myself (ably supported with some soon to be revealed logo design by <a href="http://www.ellythompson.co.uk/blog/">Elly</a>) have plans. Watch this space.</p>
<h3>Barcamp Sheffield</h3>
<p>While we&#8217;re getting out act together another northern BarCamp is about to get going. <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampSheffield">BarCamp Sheffield</a> is happening in only a few weeks time. I&#8217;m hoping to make it along, maybe just for the saturday, but if anyone else is going along let me know.</p>
<h3>HackDay</h3>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t already enought (and I haven&#8217;t even mentioned <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a>) their was something of a <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/news/archives/2007/03/hack_day_2007_g.html">big announcement</a> from <a href="http://www.thelondonbiker.com/blog/">Matt</a> over at the <span class="caps">BBC</span> today. Matt, and <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom</a> from Yahoo have put together what looks like being <em>the</em> event of the year over the weekend of June 16th and 17th. Hackday is going to involve 400 geeks (you and me and all our friends in other words) spending 48 hours hacking on APIs and the like then watching some suitably bemused band.</p>
<p>Most of these have details on <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> which I&#8217;m increasingly thinking could be incredibly useful if only a few more people used it. So after telling you to go to all these events (which would cost money) I&#8217;ll leave with telling you all to sign up for Upcoming (which costs nothing) and add <a href="http://upcoming.org/user/52694/">me</a> as a friend.</p>

      <a href="/2007/03/18/semantic-web-acronym-links-primer/">
        Semantic Web acronym links primer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>One thing you hit pretty rapidly when you start having a look into all this Semantic Web malarkey is the number of rather <em>silly</em> acronyms and abbreviations. In fairness it&#8217;s true of pretty much every technical or academic discipline I&#8217;ve come across and you can ask the people I work with what I think about that &#8211; I wont ramble on here.</p>
<p>And dont think this is all because I&#8217;m not technical enough for ya, I have code on my blog and a faintly scary collection of technical tomes. I just think acronyms tend to breed elitism and make the world less penetrable, especially when they are often described in relation to other acronyms. So, after pointing out a problem here&#8217;s a stab at a solution; a web designers guide (with the relevant links) to my understanding of the different things involved. I&#8217;m not an expert on this yet mind, so if I&#8217;m wrong and someone more knowlegable can provide a better description then please comment. If the descriptions from the relevant links I have are good enough I&#8217;ll just use those as well.</p>
<p>Most people will probably have come across <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><span class="caps">XML</span></a> so hopefully this is an easy one. <span class="caps">XML</span> is the eXtensible Markup Language. For me that means it&#8217;s a set of rules for defining your own markup language; from simple data exchange formats to whole programming languages. The W3C says (which I think nicely highlights my problem from above)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (<span class="caps">XML</span>) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from <span class="caps">SGML</span> (<span class="caps">ISO</span> 8879)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt"><span class="caps">XSLT</span></a> is another quite common tool. The W3C again defines it in relation to another acronym but this time I dont mind as much and we&#8217;ve got a defintion of <span class="caps">XML</span> here anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<span class="caps">XSLT</span> is] a language for transforming <span class="caps">XML</span> documents into other <span class="caps">XML</span> documents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty straighforward description, the only real problem for the outsider is wondering why you would want to do that!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/rdf/default.asp">W3Schools says</a> is really where the Semantic Web stuff starts. The W3C start off with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Resource Description Framework (<span class="caps">RDF</span>) integrates a variety of application&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. It integrates applications&#8230; What! But wait:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">RDF</span> specifications provide a lightweight ontology system to support the exchange of knowledge on the Web</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty good actually, as long as you&#8217;re happy with the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">ontology</a>. Their is a <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf1.html">good article</a> that takes a stab at the question from Tim Bray. I think, simply put, <span class="caps">RDF</span> is common set of rules for defining your own meta data (information about information) so it&#8217;s interopable with everyone else doing the same thing.</p>
<p>But how are we going to get all that <span class="caps">RDF</span> into our web pages (Semantic or otherwise)? <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> is one possibility (not going there right now) which involves extending <span class="caps">HTML</span> (all varieties) with some additional attributes with the purpose of being able to embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in the document. Or from the W3C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RDFa is a syntax that expresses this structured data using a set of elements and attributes that embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in <span class="caps">HTML</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-grddl-20040413/"><span class="caps">GRDDL</span></a> is probably the worst offender here in terms of someone spending too much time coming up with the acronym. It stands for <em>Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages</em>. From looking it appears to be a standard way of saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here be some <span class="caps">RDF</span>. If you want the <span class="caps">RDF</span> for this document please use this <span class="caps">XSL</span> transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml">eRDF</a>, or embedded <span class="caps">RDF</span> is a simpler approach to RDFa which involves no additional custom attributes but does not aim to be able to represent all the possible <span class="caps">RDF</span> constructs.</p>
<p>Of course their are many more, but at least that&#8217;s a start. Let me know what you think.</p>

        I&#39;m not a Werewolf!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>After the numerous games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ">Werewolf</a> at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a> recently a few of us <a href="http://kid666.com/blog/2007/02/19/werewolf-cards/">got chatting</a> about the idea of custom Werewolf cards using <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Well I&#8217;ve just finished a very simple example of this and thought I&#8217;d post it up.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFlickrwerewolf.jpg" title="Definately a Werewolf" alt="Definately a Werewolf" /></p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf">morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf</a> for a set of printable cards based on Flickr Machine Tags.</p>
<p>In the future I may enhance this with a nifty interface which lets visitors select the number of each card they want &#8211; and I spoke briefly with <a href="http://www.whitelabel.org/">Stefan</a> from <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo</a> about if it&#8217;s possible to link into printing them on those lovely Moo cards.</p>
<p>If you want anyone to appear just add the relevant werewolf machine tag!</p>

        Parsing ERDF
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Now we&#8217;ve got some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/microformats-and-erdf-sitting-in-a-tree/">eRDF in our pages</a> we need to extract it out in preparation for doing someting with it.</p>
<h3>With <span class="caps">XSL</span></h3>
<p>First up we want to try and extract the eRDF in our page into an <span class="caps">RDF</span> document. <a href="http://iandavis.com">Ian Davis</a> has already created a nice <span class="caps">XSL</span> document to do just that. and I&#8217;ve implemented a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/erdf/">nice service wrapper</a> to extract the <span class="caps">RDF</span> from a given <span class="caps">URL</span>. Try pointing it at <a href="http://morethanseven.net">morethanseven.net</a> or <a href="http://iandavis.com">iandavis.com</a> for an example of it in action. Next step here is to extend it to allow extracting a simple vcard from the <span class="caps">RDF</span> in a similar manner to <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian Suda&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">Microformats extractor</a>.</p>
<h3>With Javascript</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan Webb</a> has recently written up his <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/2007/2/9/sumo-a-generic-microformats-parser-for-javascript">Sumo! microformas parser</a> and boy is it really rather fancy. At the moment he&#8217;s only got profiles for hCard, hCalendar and hResume but writing profiles is relatively simple. Accoring to one of Dans comments he&#8217;s working on adding support for rel and rev style microformats like rel-tag and <span class="caps">XFN</span>.</p>
<p>Although billed as a Microformats parser, in reality what Dan&#8217;s created is pretty generic. You can use it to parse out any information marked up with any semantic class names &#8211; just like our eRDF.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a very basic Sumo! profile for <span class="caps">FOAF</span> and some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/foaf/">simple tests to extract eRDF data from a test page</a>. This is very much a proof of concept of extracting eRDF using Javascript but would be relatively simple to extend for the full <span class="caps">FOAF</span> spec once Dan or someone else extends Sumo! to support rel and rev.</p>
<p>On a related note the combination of Sumo! and the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> javascript console is just perfect. Anyone who hasn&#8217;t yet downloaded the latest version should get over there quick.</p>
