    <p>I&#8217;ve just found <a href="http://github.com/samuel/dreque">Dreque</a> from <a href="http://samuelks.com/">Samuel Stauffer</a> on GitHub. It&#8217;s yet another take on the whole messaging things which is definitely seeing a lot of activity at the back end of this year. It&#8217;s using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> on the backend and looks really rather nice:</p>
<p>Submitting jobs:</p>
<pre><code>from dreque import Dreque
def some_job(argument):
    pass
dreque = Dreque("127.0.0.1")
dreque.enqueue("queue", some_job, argument="foo")</code></pre>
<p>Worker:</p>
<pre><code>from dreque import DrequeWorker
worker = DrequeWorker(["queue"], "127.0.0.1")
worker.work()</code></pre>

        Erlang Screencasts

    <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to learn Erlang for a while. What I actually mean is it&#8217;s been on my list of <em>things to learn</em> for months, along with all sorts of other incredibly interesting bits and pieces. I spend a little bit of time at home but the majority of my learning time is now spent commuting to London and back most days. Sometimes I&#8217;m even going all the way to Swindon which gives me even longer to not learn Erlang.</p>
<p>The main problem with learning something new on the train is space. Reading a book (or my new Kindle) or just using my laptop is fine. Trying to do both at once is nearly impossible (I&#8217;ve tried). So I&#8217;ve decided to give another approach a try, namely screencasts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only done the first <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">Erlang in Practice</a> episode so far but I was hugely impressed with the content and general presentation. $5 as well doesn&#8217;t seem bad at all I don&#8217;t think. The episode was half an hour long, but took me a little longer, probably closer to 45 minutes, as I was playing along at home and typing the code examples as I went. I also got sidetracked with messing with my vim configuration at the same time but hey. This makes them perfect for my hour long commute. The full series is 8 episodes long and with luck I&#8217;ll be able to work through them this week.</p>
<p>So, good job <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Pragmatic</a> for a nice, accessible start to Erlang. All I need to do now is find something interesting to hack on in Erlang.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been lurking on the django-developers mailing list for the last couple of weeks and that provided an excuse to play with the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html">new Twitter Lists</a> feature. So here&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr/djangocommitters">list of djangocommitters on twitter</a>. If I missed someone do let me know. Their is a chance you won&#8217;t be able to see this if you&#8217;re not on the beta yet I think, sorry!</p>

        Problems Installing Hadoop 0.20 and Dumbo 0.21 on Ubuntu
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2009</span>

    <p>The Hadoop wiki has a great introduction to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_(Single-Node_Cluster)">installing this piece of software</a>, which I wanted to do to have a play with <a href="http://klbostee.github.com/dumbo/">Dumbo</a>. The Dumbo docs also have a good <a href="http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo/building-and-installing">getting started</a> section which includes a few patches than need to be applied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dumbo can be considered to be a convenient Python <span class="caps">API</span> for writing MapReduce programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not quite that simple, at least on Ubuntu Jaunty. Hadoop now uses Java6, but if you just follow the instructions on the wikis you&#8217;ll hit a problem when you run &#8216;&#8217;ant package&#8217;&#8216;, namely that a third party application (<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a>) requires Java 1.5. Once you fix that, the build script will complain again that you need to install Forrest. Here&#8217;s what I did to get everything working:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install ant sun-java5-jdk</pre>
<pre>su - hadoop
wget http://mirrors.dedipower.com/ftp.apache.org/forrest/apache-forrest-0.8.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-forrest-0.8.tar.gz
cd /usr/local/hadoop
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/HADOOP-1722.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/HADOOP-5450.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/MAPREDUCE-764.patch
ant package -Djava5.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun -Dforrest.home=/home/hadoop/apache-forrest-0.8/</pre>
<p>With all that out of the way you should be able to run the <a href="http://dumbotics.com/2009/05/31/dumbo-on-clouderas-distribution/">simple examples</a> found on the rather excellent <a href="http://dumbotics.com">dumbotics</a> blog. If you&#8217;re using the Cloudera distribution, or when the Hadoop 0.21 gets a release, these problems will disappear but in the meantime hopefully this saves someone else a bit of head scratching.</p>
