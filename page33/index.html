        XMPP and offline processing coming to Google App Engine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Three weeks ago I pondered whether <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/01/15/are-xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-/"><span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing were coming to Google App Engine?</a>. It was a hunch based on the upcoming release of Jaiku on App Engine. I reasoned you couldn&#8217;t really do it without <span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing APIs. Looks like I was right.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/">Joe Gregorio</a> announced on the <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/">App Engine Blog</a> an <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/02/roadmap-update.html">update to the roadmap for the next 6 months</a>; including</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for running scheduled tasks</li>
	<li>Task queues for performing background processing</li>
	<li>Ability to receive and process incoming email</li>
	<li>Support for sending and receiving <span class="caps">XMPP</span> (Jabber) messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Colour me excited. This could be the point were we start seeing more and more interesting IM interfaces. And this ticks off several of my must haves for App Engine.</p>

    <p>It turns out App Engine breaks the default behaviour of the Python debugger <span class="caps">PDB</span> by sending <span class="caps">STDOUT</span> to the browser. But with a <a href="http://jjinux.blogspot.com/2008/05/python-debugging-google-app-engine-apps.html">little bit of python</a> you can put it back in.</p>
<pre>import sys
import pdb

    setattr(sys, attr, getattr(sys, '__%s__' % attr))
pdb.set_trace()</pre>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Via <a href="http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/master">tagging a new release</a> on GitHub I see a new version of <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> (0.7) has been released. Radiant is a really nice <span class="caps">CMS</span> for smaller projects, it&#8217;s used on the official <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> site and I used it here at one point.</p>
<p>Go check out the <a href="http://radiantcms.org/blog/archives/2009/02/07/radiant-0-7-0---intaglio-release-final/">blog post for the full list of the changes</a>.</p>

        Hosting Images on App Engine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I like adding images to the occasional blog post but don&#8217;t do it as often as I want to. The reason being I can hardly ever be bothered to resize images. It means opening up a memory hogging application, fiddling around for a few minutes and then saving it out somewhere, then uploading said image to my server. All of those things bore me.</p>
<p>Appengine to the rescue. As an excuse to play around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/overview.html">image <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as add more pictures to this here blog I decided to build myself a small image hosting application. I really only care about the two things noted above; resizing and uploading. If I can do that in one go I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>A couple of train rides (all the best code gets written on train journeys, fact) later and I&#8217;ve deployed the first version of Image Host which looks a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjtBww" alt="Image Hosting interface on Google App Engine"/></p>
<p>(And yes that image is an image of image-host hosted on image-host. If you&#8217;re thinking <em>what image?</em> then it means this experiment isn&#8217;t working at the moment.)</p>
<p>The application is designed in such a way as you could have as many people uploading and managing their own set of images as you want, all within one instance. The only reason I don&#8217;t just open it up to any google user account is that it would eat into my quotas if it got popular and I have no interest in policing whatever dubious images anyone might upload.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with App Engine quite extensively of late. I really appreciate the <span class="caps">SDK</span> and the limited, but well designed and thought out APIs and testing stubs. At the moment I&#8217;m happy with where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s obviously early days but in my mind all I really want are APIs for offline processing, some sort of message queuing facility, <span class="caps">XMPP</span> support and a payment model for raising the limitations. And several of those are already slated for the near future.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to host their own version you can grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-image-host/tree/master">GtHub</a>. You&#8217;ll need your own App Engine account and your own snappy name but that&#8217;s all. If you really don&#8217;t want to do that, have a good reason to needing image hosting and ask nicely I might add more people to my version as well.</p>
<p>Their are a few bugs I&#8217;m going to fix when I get a moment,  a few documented limitations I know about and I&#8217;m still fleshing out the test suite to cover all the functionality. But all in all a worthwhile few hours spent hacking. I&#8217;ll probably get round to writing up some pointers for testing App Engine code as well as their are a host of gotchas and the only real documentation at present is comments in the code.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>The Python core developers are currently <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/">discussing whether to move away from <span class="caps">SVN</span> to a distributed version control system</a>. It&#8217;s a worthwhile read for anyone involved in this sort of decision in any capacity. It features hands on examples of each of the contenders (Bazaar, Git and Mercurial), some interesting observations about all of them as well as  some benchmarks against a mature codebase. Lots of conversations keep cropping up on Twitter about why bother switching to Git or other distributed systems &#8211; this is a good place to start whether you use Python or not.</p>
