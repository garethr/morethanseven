    <p>The Python core developers are currently <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/">discussing whether to move away from <span class="caps">SVN</span> to a distributed version control system</a>. It&#8217;s a worthwhile read for anyone involved in this sort of decision in any capacity. It features hands on examples of each of the contenders (Bazaar, Git and Mercurial), some interesting observations about all of them as well as  some benchmarks against a mature codebase. Lots of conversations keep cropping up on Twitter about why bother switching to Git or other distributed systems &#8211; this is a good place to start whether you use Python or not.</p>

        Sinatra Simple Example
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinarta</a> Ruby web development framework recently and building a <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">larger than usual Hello World Example</a>. It&#8217;s describes itself as <em>a <span class="caps">DSL</span> for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</em> (what is it about Ruby people and their obsession with calling everything a <span class="caps">DSL</span>?). In reality it&#8217;s a great little web framework. It deals with a minimal set of the things you really need to do as part of any application &#8211; <span class="caps">URL</span> handling and routing, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request and response handling, etc. It reminds me of <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> in it&#8217;s minimalist approach which is definitely a good thing.</p>
<p>The following example is the hello world given on the site</p>
<pre>require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end</pre>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t a million miles away from a web.py example:</p>
<pre>import web
urls = (
    '/', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())
class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        return 'Hello World'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()</pre>
<p>The only real difference is the separate mapping of URLs to views in web.py, which is closer to how Rails or Django do things.</p>
<p>Their is quite a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> already for Sinatra, including the start of a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html">book</a>. The code (as with all good code these days) is on <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master">github</a> for your forking pleasure.</p>
<p>As for what I&#8217;ve been up to I have a more advanced <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">Hello World</a> example up on GitHub. I&#8217;m wanting to get a running application that demonstrates all the basic features (except <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2008/04/11/dsls-for-html-and-css-the-future-or-just-plain-wro/"><span class="caps">HAML</span> and <span class="caps">SASS</span></a> support). So far I&#8217;ve got a simple bit of Rack middleware, several views demonstrating different url handling techniques, basic erb templates, before methods, configuration settings, error handling, decent unit test coverage, a rake file with a tasks for documentation, code coverage, etc. I&#8217;ve also got configuration files for running the application with <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and using <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">God</a>. I&#8217;m going to add some simple database connectivity in at some point (either <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> or <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, I haven&#8217;t decided yet) and play around with writing spec tests and a capistrano recipe file. All in it&#8217;s a nice way of learning something new at the same time as producing something that might be useful. Once I have the rest of the bits and pieces I might even right a full tutorial.</p>
<p>I think the sweet spot for these sorts of mini frameworks are small services or little applications that just sit their are run. Both <a href="http://integrityapp.com/">Integrity</a> and <a href="http://irclogger.com">IRCLogger</a> both use Sinatra for instance and I think it&#8217;s used for the <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GitHub WebHooks</a> as well. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing Google AppEngine is useful for in fact and Sinatra would likely be a closer fit that Rails if Google ever feel like adding Ruby support. Although it does depress me a little that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">top four items in the public issue tracker</a> are <em>I want my own language</em>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsonpickle">Jsonpickle</a> is a Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into <span class="caps">JSON</span>. The advantage over something like simplejson is the <em>arbitrary</em> part, simplejson throws errors when you try and serialize some types of objects. I also prefer the jsonpickle <span class="caps">API</span> (encode, decode) over simplejson (dump, dumps, load, loads).</p>

        In Defence of Apache Ant
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> build tool. Their I said it. Nearly everyone else I end up talking to about build scripts (more people that you&#8217;d think, but OK, it&#8217;s hardly the most exciting topic of conversation) either hates it or treats it with disdain.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using it for a few years on and off, in several jobs and for personal projects as well. I&#8217;ve used it while writing Python, .<span class="caps">NET</span> and <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It might be somewhat unfashionable (it&#8217;s written in Java and you write your commands in <span class="caps">XML</span>) but, for me at least, it&#8217;s incredibly handy to have around.</p>
<p>Ant is a build tool. It lets you define tasks in a config file (called build.xml) and then execute them via running the <em>ant</em> command line application. It supports dependencies between tasks as well as defining properties that can be used by multiple tasks. It supports a lot of Java specific stuff as well but also has the ability to simply execute commands on the host OS.</p>
<p>As a really simple example of a few tasks I use on more than one project involve simple backups and deployment.</p>
<p>First I set up a few properties including details of where my site files live and the <span class="caps">SSH</span> access details for the remote site.</p>
<pre>&lt;property name="username" value=""/&gt;
&lt;property name="host" value=""/&gt;
&lt;property name="dir" value=""/&gt;</pre>
<p>The first example task simply runs a backup of everything in the target directory using scp.</p>
<pre>&lt;target name="backup" description="backup site" &gt;
   &lt;exec executable="scp" dir="." failonerror="true"&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-r"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="${username}@${host}:${dir}"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="backups/${TODAY_UK}"/&gt;
   &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>If I make local changes and want to push them to the live site I have another simple task which shells out to rsync.</p>
<pre>&lt;target name="deploy" description="deploy usng rsync" &gt;
  &lt;exec executable="rsync" dir="." failonerror="true"&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-r"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="."/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="${username}@${host}:${dir}"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="--exclude-from=rsync.excludes"/&gt;
      &lt;arg value="-v"/&gt;
  &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>I know <a href="http://simonwillison.net">some people</a> hate this separate arguments as individual elements. Yes it&#8217;s excessively <span class="caps">XML</span> but it makes everything incredibly clear to anyone who might sneak a look. And build scripts change little compared to project code so the verbosity never bothers me overly. If you really want you can put everything on one line, but I find that harder to follow and maintain.</p>
<pre>&lt;target name="deploy" description="deploy usng rsync" &gt;
  &lt;exec executable="rsync" dir="." failonerror="true"&gt;
      &lt;arg line="-r . "${username}@${host}:${dir} --exclude-from=rsync.excludes -v"/&gt;
  &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;</pre>
<p>For bigger projects I tend to create more complex backup and deployment tasks, or more often than not add in various dependencies. But you hopefully get the idea. Even for simple commands like this that would be a single line bash script I tend to use ant. I find by putting things together into a build script I&#8217;m more likely to add useful functionality to it later, and to remember and therefore run the commands more often.</p>
<p>A good reference for finding out more than is in the <a href="http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html">manual</a> is the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/ant/FrontPage">Apache Ant Wiki</a>. More than anything it features real examples that you can learn from which with Ant is definitely the best way to discover new tricks.</p>
<p>I know their are a number of other tools in languages I like more. On occasion I use <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>, <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/fab">Fabric</a> and <a href="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano</a>. I&#8217;ve looked at <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/projects/vellum/">Vellum</a> and good old make. I know others who swear by just writing simple bash scripts or using straight Ruby, <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Python (or not writing build scripts at all and doing everything by hand. But I like having my build scripts separate and simple. It might not be pretty or fashionable, but Ant does almost perfectly what I want it to do.</p>
