        Django Settings Tip - Setting Relative Paths 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Django settings files are pretty interesting. Rather than being written in some sort of purely declarative markup they just use Python. This brings both lots of power as well as the ability to do things in the settings file that you probably shouldn&#8217;t do.</p>
<p>One area where I find this capability particularly useful is when specifying file system paths. Lots of the settings concern where Django can find templates, images, or stylesheets for instance. The examples given in the default settings file are all of the form <em>/this/directory/structure/</em>. If you plan on only working on your own, and never running your applications anywhere except your local machine this is probably fine. The moment you want to deploy your application, or want to collaborate with others this becomes a problem. You either have to agree upon a fixed directory structure between all developers (annoying) or have distinct settings files for each machine, which probably means them being outside source control (also annoying).</p>
<p>A better approach is to have those paths dynamically ascertained at runtime. It makes the application much more portable, making local development and production use easier. Using the standard library <em>os</em> module we can do just that.</p>
<pre>import os
import django
# calculated paths for django and the site
# used as starting points for various other paths
DJANGO_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(django.__file__))
SITE_ROOT = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))</pre>
<p>Here we set a couple of useful constants, one is the path to the site folder and the other the path to where django is stored on this machine. settings.py contains a number of places where these constants are useful. For instance the MEDIA_ROOT settings which specifies the file system location for assets like images or stylesheets. The default settings file even comes with an instruction and example showing a non portable path.</p>
<pre># Absolute path to the directory that holds media.
# Example: "/home/media/media.lawrence.com/"
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'assets')</pre>
<p>Other examples include setting the path for a SQLite database:</p>
<pre>DATABASE_ENGINE = 'sqlite3'
DATABASE_NAME = os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'db') + '/development.db'</pre>
<p>Or specifying directories in which we can place templates.</p>
<pre>TEMPLATE_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(SITE_ROOT, 'templates')
)</pre>
<p>I actually think this should probably make it&#8217;s way into the default settings file. I might very well be missing something but I can&#8217;t see when it&#8217;s not much better to do things this way.</p>

        Append slashes to URLs in Django
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Quick Django pop quiz. Can anyone spot the deliberate mistake in the following url definition? We&#8217;re trying to define a view called log_viewer and instructing a specific url pattern to render it.</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log/?$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>In this case our regex matches /log or /log/ using the /? optional pattern. This is because even if we only link to one format we know people will probably visit both, either by entering the <span class="caps">URL</span> manually or by linking from an external source.</p>
<p>As far as <span class="caps">HTTP</span> is concerned though /log and /log/ are separate URLs, even if they display the same content. The main reason this matters for public facing websites is that our friendly search engine spiders are likely to index both separately, leading to splitting the page rank as well as accusations of duplicate content which might see further erosion of rankings.</p>
<p>The solution is generally to issue a 301 redirect from one format to the other. This tells search engines and people alike that the canonical location for the requested content is elsewhere. You could specify the redirect manually, but this is going to get irritating quickly once you have a few more definitions.</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log$', redirect_to, {'url': '/log/'}),
    (r'^log/$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>Handily Django provides a mechanism to do exactly what we want to do by setting <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#append-slash">APPEND_SLASH</a> to True in your settings file. Even better it&#8217;s switched on by default. So if you don&#8217;t know much about the intricacies of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> you still get the correct behavior. That is unless you specify your <span class="caps">URL</span> patterns in the format above.</p>
<p>You see APPEND_SLASH only works if the <span class="caps">URL</span> doesn&#8217;t match a specified pattern. If no pattern match is found it appends a trailing slash and checks for a match again. Because the above pattern matches the pattern without the trailing slash (/log) the desired behavior is never triggered, and the view is rendered at both URLs. So although we want to catch /log and /log/ on the front end, our urls.py definition should actually be:</p>
<pre>urlpatterns = patterns('',
    (r'^log/$', log_viewer),
)</pre>
<p>Django has lots of useful bits of magic for doing the right thing, but unless you know what they <em>actually</em> do you either end up recreating functionality yourself, or find features don&#8217;t work in quite the way you thought. It&#8217;s a good argument for keeping frameworks small whenever possible, and for developers to at least know their way around the code of their respective framework.</p>

        XMPP and offline processing coming to Google App Engine

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Three weeks ago I pondered whether <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/01/15/are-xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-/"><span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing were coming to Google App Engine?</a>. It was a hunch based on the upcoming release of Jaiku on App Engine. I reasoned you couldn&#8217;t really do it without <span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing APIs. Looks like I was right.</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/">Joe Gregorio</a> announced on the <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/">App Engine Blog</a> an <a href="http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/02/roadmap-update.html">update to the roadmap for the next 6 months</a>; including</p>
<ul>
	<li>Support for running scheduled tasks</li>
	<li>Task queues for performing background processing</li>
	<li>Ability to receive and process incoming email</li>
	<li>Support for sending and receiving <span class="caps">XMPP</span> (Jabber) messages</li>
</ul>
<p>Colour me excited. This could be the point were we start seeing more and more interesting IM interfaces. And this ticks off several of my must haves for App Engine.</p>

    <p>It turns out App Engine breaks the default behaviour of the Python debugger <span class="caps">PDB</span> by sending <span class="caps">STDOUT</span> to the browser. But with a <a href="http://jjinux.blogspot.com/2008/05/python-debugging-google-app-engine-apps.html">little bit of python</a> you can put it back in.</p>

    <p>Via <a href="http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/master">tagging a new release</a> on GitHub I see a new version of <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> (0.7) has been released. Radiant is a really nice <span class="caps">CMS</span> for smaller projects, it&#8217;s used on the official <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> site and I used it here at one point.</p>
