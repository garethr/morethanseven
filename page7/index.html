    <p>With only a week or so to go before the end of February, it&#8217;s looking like March might be a little busy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m speaking at QCon, in London on Wednesday 6th on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Clouds%20in%20Government%20-%20Perils%20of%20Portability">Clouds in Government &#8211; Perils of Portability</a> (which in hindsight is probably the silliest title for a talk I&#8217;ve ever used)</li>
	<li>On the 15th and 16th of March I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/">Devopsdays</a>, again in London. I&#8217;ve been helping out with organising the event and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to going along after seeing all the work being put in.</li>
	<li>And last but not least I&#8217;m heading to Boston for the rather exciting <a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> from the 26th until the 30th. Looking forward to meeting up in person with quite a few folks I&#8217;ve spoken to over the last year or two.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be at any of these events (QCon and Devopsdays still have tickets available I think) then let me know.</p>

    <p>About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/">London Web Performance</a> meetup. This was one of the first talks I&#8217;ve done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.</p>

    <p>I had great fun back in November at the <a href="http://qconsf.com/">QCon</a> conference in San Francisco. As well as currating one of the tracks and catching up with people in the area I managed to give the following talk.</p>

As well as a large set of tips, tricks and tools I settled on a few things that I think any web (or other) framework should support out of the box.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A debug toolbar</li>
	<li>Transparent caching support</li>
	<li>Hooks for instrumentation</li>
	<li>Configurable logging</li>

    <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages/">big fan of system packages for lots of reasons</a> and have often ended up rolling my own debian package repository at work, or working with others that have done so. Recently I finally got round to setting up a personal package repo, at <a href="http://packages.garethrushgrove.com">packages.garethrushgrove.com</a>. More interesting than the repo is probably the tool chain I used, oh and the rather nice bootstrap based styling.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjh1wIM" alt="nice looking package repository"/></p>
<p>The source code for everything is <a href="https://github.com/garethr/packages">on GitHub</a> although not much documentation exists yet. In the middle are a few shell scripts that generate the repo. Around them is a Vagrant box (which makes it easier to build packages for different achitectures or distros) and some Rake commands</p>
<pre><code>bundle exec rake -T
rake recipes:build[recipe]  # Build a package from one of the available recipes
rake recipes:list           # List available recipes
rake repo:build             # Build the repository</code></pre>
<p>The recipes commands allow for building new packages based on scripts. A few examples are included which use fpm, but you could use anything. The repo:build command triggers the debian repository to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The vagrant configuration shares various folders between and guest and host which also opens up a few useful features. One is I can just drop any old debian package into the debs folder and run the repo:build command and it will be in my repository. The other useful capability is that the resulting repo is shared back to the host, which means I can then check it into Git and in my case push it up to Heroku.</p>

        On the forge
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been spending a bit of time recently pushing a few Puppet modules to the <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com">Forge</a>. This is Puppetlabs attempt to make a central repository of reusable puppet modules. I started doing it as a bit of an experiment, to find out what I liked and what worked and I decided to writeup a few opinions.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve shipped the following modules:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Riemann</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/graphite">Graphite</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/logstash">Logstash</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/freight">Freight</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a few of these started as forks of other modules but have evolved quite a bit towards being more reusable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also started sending pull requests for modules that basically do what I want but don&#8217;t always play well with others.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/thomasvandoren/puppet-redis/pull/10">Redis</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Improved tools</h2>
<p>It turns out the experience is mainly a pleasurable one, partly down to the much improved tooling around Puppet. Specifically I&#8217;m making extensive use of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://rspec-puppet.com/">Rspec Puppet</a> &#8211; for writing tests for module behavious</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian Puppet</a> &#8211; dependency management for modules</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs_spec_helper">Puppet spec helper</a> &#8211; conventions and helpers for testing modules</li>
	<li><a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> &#8211; easy continuous integration for module code</li>
	<li><a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> &#8211; manage virtual machines, useful for smoke testing on different distributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of those tools make testing Puppet modules both easier and useful. Here&#8217;s an example of one of the above modules being tested. Note that it&#8217;s run across Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 and 1.9.3 and Puppet versions 2.7.17, 2.7.18 and 3.0.1 for a total of 9 builds. Handily the Redis module mentioned also had a test suite. The pull request includes changes to that, and Travis <a href="https://travis-ci.org/thomasvandoren/puppet-redis/builds/3462513">automatically tested the pull request</a> for the modules author.</p>
<h2>Antipatterns</h2>
<p>Using modules from the Forge really forces you to think about reusability. The pull request mentioned above for the Redis module for instance replaced an explicit mention of the build-essential package with the &#8220;puppetlabs/gcc&#8221;: class from the Forge. This makes the module less self contained, but without that change the module is incompatible with any other module that also uses that common package. I also went back and replaced explicit references to wget and build-essential in my Riemann module.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb. For a specific module only include resources that are unique to the software the module manages. Anything else should be in another module with a dependency in the Modulefile.</p>
<p>This can feel a little much when you&#8217;re replacing a simple Package resource with a whole new module but it has two advantages I care about. As well as the ability to use the module with other third party modules more easily it also makes it more likely that the module will work cross platform.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s missing?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see a few things improved when it comes to the Forge.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;d like to be able to publish a new version of a module without having to use the web interface. The current workflow involves running a build command, then uploading the generated artifact via a web form after logging in.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;d like to see best practice module development guides front and centre on the Forge. Lots of modules won&#8217;t work with other modules and I think that&#8217;s fixable.</li>
	<li>Integration with puppet-lint would be nice, giving some indication of whether the authors care about the Puppet styleguide.</li>
	<li><del>A command line search interface would be useful</del>. And <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/man/module.html">turns out to exist</a>. Thanks <a href="http://twitter.com/a1cy">@a1cy</a> for the heads up.</li>
	<li>The Forge tracks number of downloads, but as a publisher I don&#8217;t know how often my modules have been downloaded.</li>
	<li>And finally I&#8217;d like to see more people using it.</li>
