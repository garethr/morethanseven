        Solr Libraries and Good API Design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jan 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m a huge <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> fan. Once you understand what it does (it&#8217;s a search engine, which means more than you think) and how it works you spot lots of thorny problems that map to it&#8217;s features really well. In my experience it&#8217;s also very fast and very stable once installed and setup. Oh, and the community support is great as well.</p>
<p>When I talk to some folks about Solr all they can think about is full text search. The main reason for this I think is a number of poor libraries. I&#8217;ve come across lots of Python or Ruby libraries that simply say you don&#8217;t have to know anything about Solr, just install this code and you get full text search! This works in the same way as using the default Mysql or Apache configs works, nowhere near as well as if you get your hands dirty even a little. Some of the ruby gems even ship the Solr jar file in the gem. Now you don&#8217;t even need to know Solr exists. You take a generic configuration and run it using a rake task behind which is some unknown Java application server. Good luck debugging that when it goes wrong, that&#8217;s one hell of a leeky abstraction.</p>
<p>In better news I&#8217;ve now found two excellent Solr libraries, one&#8217;s that start with the assumption that you know what you&#8217;re doing or happy to learn about the tools you&#8217;re using. All you really want from a library is a good <span class="caps">API</span> that maps to how you write in that language.</p>
<h2>Delsolr (Ruby)</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://delsolr.rubyforge.org/">delsolr</a> <span class="caps">API</span> is beautiful. It seemlessly merges the worlds of Ruby and Solr in a way that&#8217;s easy to write and easy to guess. It&#8217;s also clever, the design accepts that new features might be added to Solr before the library is updated or that the library might not support every usecase or option. In these cases you can still pass information through to Solr directly.</p>
<p>Solr&#8217;s interface is based around URLs, so any library is really just giving you an interface to creating those URLs.Writing the following in Ruby:</p>
<pre>rsp = solr.query('standard',
               :query =&gt; '*:*',
               :filters =&gt; {:status =&gt; 'Active'},
               :facets =&gt; [{:field =&gt; 'project'}]
    ])</pre>
<p>Results in the following <span class="caps">URL</span>:</p>
<pre>/select?q=*:*&amp;wt=ruby&amp;facet=true&amp;facet.field=status&amp;facet.field=name&amp;fq=status:Active</pre>
<p>If you already know Solr and how to construct URLs for searches by hand you&#8217;ll immediately get the Ruby code. You can probably even guess how to pass other params like sort or order.</p>
<p>Another nice touch is that you can use either hashes or Lucene search syntax for each attribute. So:</p>
<pre>:filters =&gt; {:status =&gt; 'Active'}</pre>
<p>Is the same as:</p>
<pre>:filters =&gt; 'status:Active'</pre>
<h2>Sunburnt (Python)</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.timetric.com/2010/02/08/sunburnt-a-python-solr-interface">Sunburnt</a> is a python Solr interface from the nice folks at <a href="http://timetric.com">Timetric</a>. I&#8217;ve not had chance to use this library in anger as it was released after I&#8217;d dont quite a bit of python-solr work in an old job but I&#8217;d definately use it now. The <span class="caps">API</span> looks like:</p>
<pre>rsp = solr.query('*:*').filter(status='Active').facet_by('project').execute()</pre>
<p>It&#8217;s based around chaining so again you can probably guess how to make further queries from even this simple example.</p>
<p>Both Sunburnt and Delsolr also support adding documents to the index.</p>
<h2>Uses</h2>
<p>Once you understand facets and the usefulness of filter queries you see lots of places where Solr is useful apart from text search. Lots of ecommerce operations use facetted search interfaces, I&#8217;m sure everyone has spent time clicking through nested heirachies and watching the numbers (showing the number of products) next to the links decrease? You can built these interfaces using <span class="caps">SQL</span> but it&#8217;s incredibly expensive and gets out of hand quickly. Caching only helps a bit due to the number of permutations in all but the smallest stores or simplest products. It&#8217;s a similar problem with tagging, it&#8217;s pretty easy to kill your database</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just things that have the word search in that you can map Solr to. Two good examples are Timetric (from whom the Sunburnt library comes from) and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/what-is-powering-the-content-api">Guardian Content <span class="caps">API</span></a>. Both of these present lots of read data straight from Solr with great success and less database killing performance issues. Solr can really be seen as a simple place to denormalise your data, one advantage being that it keeps your database schema clean.</p>
<h2>Learning More</h2>
<p>Solr could do with better documentation for beginners. The wiki is an excellent reference once you know how to write schema and configuration files but I think the getting started section sacrifices introducing configuration in favour of getting people searching quicker. The example schema and solrconfig files that ship with Solr are also amazingly useful references (officially the best commented <span class="caps">XML</span> I&#8217;ve ever seen) but also intimidating to beginners. The Drupal community appear to be writing some good docs that fill this gap though, here&#8217;s a few links that I&#8217;d recommend:</p>

        A Vagrant Ecosystem
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Dec 2010</span>

    <p>As mentioned loudly and repeatedly on here and on Twitter I love <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a>. While writing a chef cookbook to bootstrap my virtual machines I started thinking about how things around vagrant could help it be more useful. These might be things I&#8217;m going to do, or ideally get involved with others to do. If anyone has any other ideas, or suggestions please leave comments, I definately think this is the time for discussion.</p>
<h2>Baseboxes</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t really want to have to maintain baseboxes but I want access to lots of them. I&#8217;m sure some people will want a <em>Ruby on Rails in a box</em> but all I really care about is having access to recent 32 and 63 bit vanilla linux distributions. I want a good source for trusted baseboxes. At the moment the approach is to look on the wiki, then look on the mailing list and then search the web, then create your own (even using <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee">VeeWee</a> it&#8217;s still a little fiddly). I&#8217;ve managed to find good lucid, maverick and debian boxes, but have had problems with centos and a few others. Part of this is the rate of change recenty of both vagrant and now VirtualBox (both good things), part of it is the lack of reviews and shared experiences around baseboxes.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d love to see is a single place where anyone can post a link to a basebox and vagrant users can come along and assign metadata about whether it worked and on what hardware, vagrant version, virtual box version, etc. It could even act as a tracker, counting downloads of boxes to gauge popularity.</p>
<h2>Templated Vagrantfiles</h2>
<p>As mentioned previously I have a chef cookbook I use to bootstrap all my new virtual machines. My process is therefore: <em>vagrant init</em>, make some manual changes to the Vagrantfile (or copy it from elsewhere), <em>vagrant up</em>. I&#8217;m lazy and want a nicer way to reuse Vagrantfiles or to script their creation.</p>
<p>I started out thinking that the ability to point the init command at a template and to provide context on the command line might be a good idea. Now I&#8217;m wondering whether we just need a command line application which allows for writing or modifying the Vagrantfile? Something like:</p>
<pre>vagrant config vm.provisioner=:chef_solo
vagrant config chef.recipe_url=http://cloud.github.com/downloads/garethr/chef-repo/cookbooks.tar.gz</pre>
<h2>Hosted cookbooks</h2>
<p>I dissed the idea of a <em>Ruby on Rails in a box</em> basebox above but I still want to be able to let people more easily share custom configuration for specialist applications. But what I&#8217;d prefer would be people sharing packaged cookbooks, a bit like I&#8217;ve done for my default virtual machine setup. Again the beauty of this is it&#8217;s pretty much just sharing a <span class="caps">URL</span> to a tar.gz file. This makes more sense to me at least than random people connecting to my chef server (I shouldn&#8217;t know about their machines) and lowers the barrier to entry for those not interested in hosting their own chef server or using the opscode platform for local virtual machines.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also not talking here about just sharing individual cookbooks like <a href="http://cookbooks.opscode.com/">cookbooks.opscode.com</a>, but rather a packaged collection of individual recipes designed for a specific purpose. A fully working solr instance, a django application server using apache/mod_wsgi, etc.</p>
<p>Many of the points about baseboxes above would work here too I think. Having a good community resource which points to lots of cookbook tar files. Allowing people to feed back about what works for them. I&#8217;ve mainly taked about Chef here as that&#8217;s what vagrant initially shipped with, with the puppet provisioner now ready to go with would stand for puppet manifests too.</p>

      <a href="/2010/11/28/Sinatra-on-glassfish-example/">
        Sinatra On Glassfish Example
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Nov 2010</span>

    <p>I magically turned into a Java developer last week for a bit when I had to do some integration with a <span class="caps">SOAP</span> based <span class="caps">API</span> that really really wanted me to write Java on client as well. That led me down the route of having a good look at Jruby (which I&#8217;ve used before, mainly for testing using celerity) and in particular how easy it was to use native Java classes in Jruby (very, very easy as it turns out).</p>
<p>All that meant I&#8217;ll probably end up writing a nice Jruby application in the not too distant future, and not knowing too much about running such a thing in a production environment I thought I&#8217;d take a quick look. I went with Glassfish as the application server for no other reason that it took my fancy. I&#8217;d definately be interested in hearing about any positive or negative experiences people may have with it or other similar servers. My quick look turned into running a tiny Sinatra application.</p>
<p>First install the required gems for our little experiment. You&#8217;ll obviously need jruby which is sort of the point, I&#8217;d recommend using <span class="caps">RVM</span> for that.</p>
<pre><code>gem install sinatra warbler</pre><p></code></p>
<p>Now create a sinatra app. OK, it could be any Ruby rack based application but I like Sinatra. First we need a rackup file.</p>
<pre><code># config.ru
require 'init'

set :run, false
set :environment, :production

run Sinatra::Application</pre><p></code></p>
<p>Now for our application itself.</p>
<pre><code># init.rb
require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  "Hello World!"
end</pre><p></code></p>
<p>Warble is the gem we&#8217;re going to use to create a <span class="caps">WAR</span> file, which is basically an all in one bundle of our application and it&#8217;s dependencies which we can deploy to a java application server.</p>
<pre><code># config/warble.rb
Warbler::Config.new do |config|
  config.dirs = %w(config)
  config.includes = FileList["init.rb"]
  config.gems += ["sinatra"]
  config.gems -= ["rails"]
  config.gem_dependencies = true
end</pre><p></code></p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to generate our <span class="caps">WAR</span> file.</p>
<pre><code>warble</pre><p></code></p>
<p>This should create a file called sample.war or similar. Then just deploy that to your application server and away you go. I got this working very easily with Glassfish which seemed to be the recommended tool for such things. Installing Glassfish was time consuming but <a href="http://www.nabisoft.com/tutorials/glassfish/installing-glassfish-301-on-ubuntu">well documented here</a>. Uploading to Glassfish was done via the web interface for the moment. I just selected a Ruby project from the deployment drop down and uploaded the war file.</p>
