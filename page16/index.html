        Working For Freeagent
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2010</span>

    <p>So, I&#8217;ve just accepted a new job at <a href="http://freeagentcentral.com">FreeAgent</a>, the rather snappy online small business accounting startup. I&#8217;ll be starting in about a month, when I get back from devopsdays in Hamburg.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m joining a pretty well knit group of designers and developers working on a pretty well loved piece of software. I&#8217;ve known Roan (one of the directors) for years, ever since the first Highland Fling conference I think. And the rest of the team seem a good mix of technical smarts and professionalism. Hopefully I can live up to their already high standards.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to jumping into a decent sized Ruby project and getting properly reacquainted with Rails as well. I&#8217;ve spent most of the previous few years in the Python world so that should be a nice challenge. I&#8217;m constantly impressed with the number of high quality tools written in Ruby andRails 3 looks a genuinely nice piece of software. Hopefully with a bit more idiomatic ruby under my belt, more time on my hands and some new real world problems to solve I&#8217;ll increase my open source contributions and get back to writing again as well. I&#8217;ll likely be spending most of my time on those good developer staples new feature development, supporting existing code and scaling systems. I&#8217;ll also be involved in some operations stuff if I get chance, introducing software I&#8217;m a huge fan of and automating everything I can get my hands on.</p>
<p>The rest of the team are based up in Edinburgh but I&#8217;ll be working from home most of the time. I&#8217;m quite looking forward to working from Cambridge after having lived here for a few years. I&#8217;ll also get to see various friends in Edinburgh that I don&#8217;t get chance to meet up with very often and still have time to make it to London for the odd event or get together. I&#8217;ll likely be looking into coworking spaces or desk shares in and around Cambridge so if anyone has any recommendations.</p>
<p>Given this weeks pubstandards is apparently all about weddings, birthdays and new jobs (and I have all 3 within a month) it would be rude not to go along for at least one drink. If you&#8217;re around London I might see you there.</p>

        Script Running Web Interface With Websockets
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Sep 2010</span>

    <p>After something of a break I found a bit of time for some hacking at the weekend and decided to scratch a personal itch. I like writing shell scripts for everything from checking on things to deploying code. For anything that is more than just executing one command, or anything with detailed output or that takes a while I like to be able to see what&#8217;s going on. I also like to (OK, only sometimes) let other people run those commands and not all those people want to check something out and run a console. The web maks a pretty good interface for this sort of situation.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://github.com/garethr/bolt/">Bolt</a>. It&#8217;s my first proper go at using websockets for the communication between client and server, and my first stab at EventMachine. The code at the moment needs some improvement (tests, configurability, deployment options) but it works as a proof of concept.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple, designed for running a single command at the push of a button and showing the results scroll past as they happen.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRi5lAEM" alt="Bolt script running interface"/></p>
<p>Hopefully it&#8217;s useful to a few more people, or at least it will be when I clean it up a bit. For more information head over to the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/bolt/">GitHub page</a>.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m getting married rather soon so time has been somewhat short (in a good way) for just hacking on stuff, but I&#8217;ve finally found a little bit of time to play with something I&#8217;ve been mulling over for a while. Namely a continuous deployment workflow using the integrity continous integration server.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to have an incredibly simple but fully operation example available at some point &#8211; mainly to act as a good discussion point. For now here&#8217;s my current pre-receive hook.</p>

        Python: What To Use?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2010</span>

    <p>My friend <a href="http://jamieonsoftware.com">Jamie Rumbelow</a> has started a new project and decided to use Python. He asked a great question over on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3143115/architecting-from-scratch-in-python-what-to-use">Stack Overflow</a> which basically came down to <em>what should I use for my first proper Python web application project</em>. After a quick prompting on twitter I decided to have a go. I&#8217;ve cross posted my anwser below more because it took as long as a typical blog post to write.</p>
<h2>Frameworks</h2>
<p>OK, so I&#8217;m a little biased here as I currently make extensive use of Django and organise the Django User Group in London so bear that in mind when reading the following.</p>
<p>Start with Django because it&#8217;s a great gateway drug. Lots of documentation and literature, a very active community of people to talk to and lots of example code around the web.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a completely non-technical reason. Pylons is probably purer in terms of Python philosophy (being much more a collection of discrete bits and pieces) but lots of the technical stuff is personal preference, at least until you get into Python more. Compare the very active Django tag on Stack Overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and I&#8217;d argue getting started is simply easier with Django irrespective of anything to do with code.</p>
<p>Personally I default to Django, but find that an increasing amount of time I actually opt for writing using simpler micro frameworks (think Sinatra rather than Rails). Lots of things to choose from (<a href="http://fewagainstmany.com/blog/python-micro-frameworks-are-all-the-rage">good list here</a>). I tend to use <span class="caps">MNML</span> (because I wrote parts of it and it&#8217;s tiny) but others are actively developed. I tend to do this for small, stupid web services which are then strung together with a Django project in the middle serving people.</p>
<p>Worth noting here is appengine. You have to work within it&#8217;s limitations and it&#8217;s not designed for everything but it&#8217;s a great way to just play with Python and get something up and working quickly. It makes a great testbed for learning and experimentation.</p>
<h2>Mongo/<span class="caps">ORM</span></h2>
<p>On the MongoDB front you&#8217;ll likely want to look at the <a href="http://api.mongodb.org/python/">basic python mongo library</a> first to see if it has everything you need. If you really do want something a little more <span class="caps">ORM</span> like then <a href="http://hmarr.com/mongoengine/">mongoengine</a> might be what you&#8217;re looking for. A bunch of folks are also working on making Django specifically integrate more seamlessly with nosql backends. Some of that is for future Django releases, but <a href="http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel">django-norel</a> has code now.</p>
<p>For relational data <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is good if you want something standalone. Django&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span> is also excellent if you&#8217;re using Django.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">API</span></h2>
<p>The most official Oauth library is <a href="http://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2">python-oauth2</a>, which handily has a Django example as part of it&#8217;s docs.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home">Piston</a> is a Django app which provides lots of tools for building APIs. It has the advantage of being pretty active and well maintained and in production all over the place. Other projects exist too, including <a href="http://zacharyvoase.github.com/dagny/">Dagny</a> which is an early attempt to create something akin to RESTful resources in Rails.</p>
<p>In reality any Python framework (or even just raw <span class="caps">WSGI</span> code) should be reasonably good for this sort of task.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Python has unittest as part of it&#8217;s standard library, and unittest2 is in python 2.7 (but <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2/0.1.4">backported to previous versions too</a>). Some people also like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/">Nose</a>, which is an alternative test runner with some additional features. <a href="http://twill.idyll.org/">Twill</a> is also nice, it&#8217;s a &#8220;a simple scripting language for Web browsing&#8221;, so handy for some functional testing. <a href="http://github.com/rlisagor/freshen">Freshen</a> is a port of cucumber to Python. I haven&#8217;t yet gotten round to using this in anger, but a quick look now suggests it&#8217;s much better than when I last looked.</p>
<p>I actually also use Ruby for high level testing of Python apps and apis because I love the combination of celerity and cucumber. But I&#8217;m weird and get funny looks from other Python people for this.</p>
<h2>Message Queues</h2>
<p>For a message queue, whatever language I&#8217;m using, I now always use RabbitMQ. I&#8217;ve had some success with stompserver in the past but Rabbit is awesome. Don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s not itself written in Python, neither is PostgresSQL, Nginx or MongoDB &#8211; all for good reason. What you care about are the libraries available. What you&#8217;re looking for here is <a href="http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/">py-amqplib</a> which is a low level library for talking amqp (the protocol for talking to rabbit as well as other message queues). I&#8217;ve also used <a href="http://github.com/ask/carrot/">Carrot</a>, which is easier to get started with and provides a nicer <span class="caps">API</span>. Think bunny in Ruby if you&#8217;re familiar with that.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Whatever bits and pieces you decide to use from the Python ecosystem I&#8217;d recommend getting to who <a href="http://clemesha.org/blog/2009/jul/05/modern-python-hacker-tools-virtualenv-fabric-pip/">pip and virtualenv</a> &#8211; note that fabric is also cool, but not essential and these docs are out of date on that tool). Think about using Ruby without gem, bundler or rvm and you&#8217;ll be in the right direction.</p>

<p>The videos from the <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/"><span class="caps">DIBI</span></a> conference are now up on <a href="http://vimeo.com/groups/48480/videos">Vimeo</a>. Lots of good stuff and more to come. The one disadvantage of a a two track conference is you miss half the talks so when I get a chance I&#8217;ll be catching up with those talks I didn&#8217;t get chance to see.</p>
