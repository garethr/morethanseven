        Django and WSGI deployment on Solaris
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m generally an Ubuntu guy, but I&#8217;ve just had the need to setup some boxes running Solaris for Django and a handful of <span class="caps">WSGI</span> applications. I know my way around Ubuntu pretty well. I know all the packages I need to install and in what order. Hell, I even have all that scripted so I can just run a command and it works by magic. I&#8217;ll script the following steps if I can do when I get round to it but here, in one list, are the installation instructions for Apache, mod_wsgi, Mysql, MySQLdb, setuptools and memcached that worked for me on the latest version of <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/">Open Solaris</a> (2009.06 at the time of writing).</p>
<p>First up I needed to install Apache and start the service running.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWapch22
svcadm enable http:apache22</pre>
<p>You should be able to test that&#8217;s running by hitting localhost on a browser running on the same box. Now for MySQL.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmysql5
svcadm enable mysql:version_50</pre>
<p>This installs the mysql binary into /usr/mysql/5.0/bin/mysql on the system I&#8217;m working on. As I want to talk to the MySQL database server using Python I need to install MySQLdb.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmysql-python
ln -s /usr/mysql/5.0/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient_r.so.15 /usr/lib/libmysqlclient_r.so.15</pre>
<p>This installs the library files into /usr/mysql/5.0/lib and Python doesn&#8217;t know were to find them. The above command links them into the more standard /usr/lib folder were Python will pick it up nicely.</p>
<p>I tend to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> for serving Python apps behind Apache,  however a mod_wsgi package isn&#8217;t part of the default package list. It is however available in the pending list so first you need to add that list of packages.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg set-authority -O http://pkg.opensolaris.org/pending pending
pfexec pkg refresh
pfexec pkg install mod-wsgi</pre>

<p>This installs the module but you then need to tell Apache to load it. Add the following line to /etc/apache2/2.2/conf.d/modules-32.load or /etc/apache2/2.2/conf.d/modules-64.load depending on your architecture.</p>
<pre>LoadModule wsgi_module    libexec/mod_wsgi.so</pre>
<p>To get Apache to load that module you need to restart it like so:</p>
<pre>svcadm restart http:apache22</pre>
<p>I use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">Pip</a> for installing Python code, but tend to install setuptools to make installing Pip easier. I don&#8217;t know if an up to date Pip package exists.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install python-setuptools</pre>
<p>This should leave you with easy_install on your path so installing Pip, then virtualenv should be a breeze.</p>
<p>As an added bonus I also installed memcached for some snappy caching.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmemcached</pre>
<p>This won&#8217;t start up by default and needs a little configuration. The first command will launch you into a prompt where you can type the rest of the commands.</p>
<pre>svccfg
svc:&gt; select memcached
svc:/application/database/memcached&gt; setprop memcached/options=("-u" "nobody")
svc:/application/database/memcached&gt; quit</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;d done that you should be able to start memcache on the standard port.</p>
<pre>svcadm refresh memcached
svcadm enable memcached</pre>
<p>Et voila. The internet helped massively on my quest to track down this information. Not all of the following links turned out to work for me but all of them led me in the right direction. Thanks everyone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Solaris admin. I&#8217;m not really a sysadmin at all, I just end up pretending to be one of late. Any experienced Solaris people with experience of these tools reading this I&#8217;d be grateful for any hints and tips. Hopefully this saves a few people from the head scratching I&#8217;ve been doing for the last few days.</p>

        Your Own PyPi server
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>So one of the problems with using pip or easy_install as part of an automated deployment process is they rely on an internet connection. More than that, they rely on PyPi being up as it&#8217;s a centralised system, unlike all the apt package mirrors.</p>
<p>The best solution seems to be to host your own PyPi compliant server. Not only can you load all the third party modules you use onto it, but you could also upload any internal applications or libraries that you like. By running this on your local network you ensure your not dependent on pypi or an internet connection.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m playing with <a href="http://github.com/ask/chishop/tree/master">Chishop</a> which is a django application for maintaining a PyPi compatible server. Another alternative if that doesn&#8217;t work out is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/EggBasket/">EggBasket</a></p>
<p>To install from your own PyPi server you can specify the location of your Chishop instance with the -i flag.</p>
<pre>easy_install -i http://localhost:8000/ PACKAGE_NAME</pre>
<p>This will fall back to the PyPi server if it doesn&#8217;t find the relevant package. If you want to stop that behaviour and make sure you have a local package then you can limit the hosts with the -H flag like so.</p>
<pre>easy_install -H localhost:8000 -i http::/localhost:8000/ PACKAGE_NAME</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m not yet sure how to do this with pip, if someone wants to enlighten me in the comments then I&#8217;d be most grateful.</p>

      <a href="/2009/07/27/fabric-django-git-apache-mod-wsgi-virtualenv-and-p/">
        Fabric, Django, Git, Apache, mod_wsgi, virtualenv and pip deployment
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with automating Django deployments again, this time using <a href="http://fabfile.org/">Fabric</a>. I found a number of examples on the web but non of them quite fit the bill for me. I don&#8217;t like serving directly from a repository, I like to have either a package or tar I can use to say &#8220;that is what went to the server&#8221;. I also like having a quick rollback command as well as being able to deploy a particular version of the code when the need arises. I also wanted to go from a clean ubuntu install (plus <span class="caps">SSH</span>) to a running Django application in one command from the local development machine. The Apache side of things is nicely documented in <a href="http://gist.github.com/106077">this Gist</a> which made a good starting point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still missing a few things in this setup mind and at the moment you still have to setup your local machine yourself. I&#8217;m probably going to create a paster template and another fabfile to do that I think. The instructions are a little rough as well at the moment and I&#8217;ve left the database out of it as everyone has there own preference.</p>
<p>This particular fabric file makes setting up and deploying a django application much easier, but it does make a few assumptions. Namely that you&#8217;re using Git, Apache and mod_wsgi and your using Debian or Ubuntu. Also you should have  Django installed on your local machine and <span class="caps">SSH</span> installed on both the local machine and any servers you want to deploy to.</p>
<p><em>note that I&#8217;ve used the name project_name throughout this example. Replace this with whatever your project is called.</em></p>
<p>First step is to create your project locally:</p>
<pre>mkdir project_name
cd project_name
django-admin.py startproject project_name</pre>
<p>Now add a requirements file so pip knows to install Django. You&#8217;ll probably add other required modules in here later. Creat a file called requirements.txt and save it at the top level with the following contents:</p>
<pre>Django</pre>
<p>Then save this fabfile.py file in the top level directory which should give you:</p>
<pre>project_name
    fabfile.py
    requirements.txt
    project_name
        __init__.py
        manage.py
        settings.py
        urls.py</pre>
<p>You&#8217;ll need a <span class="caps">WSGI</span> file called project_name.wsgi, where project_name  is the name you gave to your django project. It will probably look like the following, depending on your specific paths and the location of your settings module</p>
<pre>import os
import sys
# put the Django project on sys.path
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "../")))
os.environ["DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE"] = "project_name.settings"
from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler
application = WSGIHandler()</pre>
<p>Last but not least you&#8217;ll want a virtualhost file for apache which looks  something like the following. Save this as project_name in the inner directory. You&#8217;ll want to change /path/to/project_name/ to the location on the remote server you intent to deploy to.</p>
<pre>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
        WSGIDaemonProcess project_name-production user=project_name group=project_name threads=10 python-path=/path/to/project_name/lib/python2.6/site-packages
        WSGIProcessGroup project_name-production
        WSGIScriptAlias / /path/to/project_name/releases/current/project_name/project_name.wsgi
        &lt;Directory /path/to/project_name/releases/current/project_name&gt;
            Order deny,allow
            Allow from all
        &lt;/Directory&gt;
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
        LogLevel warn
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/access.log combined
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>
<p>Now create a file called .gitignore, containing the following. This prevents the compiled python code being included in the repository and the archive we use for deployment.</p>
<pre>*.pyc</pre>
<p>You should now be ready to initialise a git repository in the top level project_name directory.</p>
<pre>git init
git add .gitignore project_name
git commit -m "Initial commit"</pre>
<p>All of that should leave you with</p>
<pre>project_name
    .git
    .gitignore
    requirements.txt
    fabfile.py
    project_name
        __init__.py
        project_name
        project_name.wsgi
        manage.py
        settings.py
        urls.py</pre>
<p>In reality you might prefer to keep your wsgi files and virtual host files elsewhere. The fabfile has a variable (config.virtualhost_path) for this case.  You&#8217;ll also want to set the hosts that you intend to deploy to (config.hosts) as well as the user (config.user).</p>
<p>The first task we&#8217;re interested in is called setup. It installs all the  required software on the remote machine, then deploys your code and restarts the webserver.</p>
<pre>fab local setup</pre>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made a few changes and commit them to the master Git branch you can run to deply the changes.</p>
<pre>fab local deploy</pre>
<p>If something is wrong then you can rollback to the previous version.</p>
<pre>fab local rollback</pre>
<p>Note that this only allows you to rollback to the release immediately before the latest one. If you want to pick a arbitrary release then you can use the following, where 20090727170527 is a timestamp for an existing release.</p>
<pre>fab local deploy_version:20090727170527</pre>
<p>If you want to ensure your tests run before you make a deployment then you can do the following.</p>
<pre>fab local test deploy</pre>
<p>The actual fabfile looks like this. I&#8217;ve uploaded a <a href="http://gist.github.com/156623">Gist of it</a>, along with the docs, so if you want to improve it please clone it.</p>

      <a href="/2009/07/23/whats-new-django-11/">
        What's new in Django 1.1
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>With the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2009/jul/21/rc/">release candidate for Django 1.1</a> out the door I decided to have a quick look at what&#8217;s new. This isn&#8217;t a complete list, rather the bits I found most interesting.</p>
<h2><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/conditional-view-processing/">Conditional Views</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Django now has much better support for conditional view processing using the standard ETag and Last-Modified <span class="caps">HTTP</span> headers. This means you can now easily short-circuit view processing by testing less-expensive conditions. For many views this can lead to a serious improvement in speed and reduction in bandwidth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice set of decorators for dealing with ETags and Last-Modified headers. Again very simple to use and set up, and a simple way of squeezing a little more performance out of you application.</p>
<h2><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/actions/#ref-contrib-admin-actions">Admin Actions</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The basic workflow of Django’s admin is, in a nutshell, “select an object, then change it.” This works well for a majority of use cases. However, if you need to make the same change to many objects at once, this workflow can be quite tedious. In these cases, Django’s admin lets you write and register “actions” – simple functions that get called with a list of objects selected on the change list page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anything that makes the admin a little more powerful and a little more flexible is a good idea in my book. Admin actions allow you to run code over multiple objects at once, simple select them with a checkbox then select an action to run. This is worth it for the delete action alone, but you can write your own actions simply enough as well (for instance for approving a batch of comments, or archiving a set or articles.)</p>
<h2><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#admin-list-editable">Editable Admin List Items</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now make fields editable on the admin list views via the new list_editable admin option. These fields will show up as form widgets on the list pages, and can be edited and saved in bulk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another time saving admin addition, this time for making some fields editable from the change list rather than the object view. For quick changes, especially to boolean fields, I think this again is a nice addition.</p>
<h2><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/options/#django.db.models.Options.managed">Unmanaged Models</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now control whether or not Django creates database tables for a model using the managed model option. This defaults to True, meaning that Django will create the appropriate database tables in syncdb and remove them as part of reset command. That is, Django manages the database table’s lifecycle. If you set this to False, however, no database table creating or deletion will be automatically performed for this model. This is useful if the model represents an existing table or a database view that has been created by some other means.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I particularly like this addition. One of the issues I had with Django was some of the built in assumptions, in particular that you&#8217;d be using a <span class="caps">SQL</span> database backend. Using unmanaged models looks like a great approach to using an alternative database like couchdb, tokyotyrant or mongodb or representing a webservice interface in your application.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have missed a few other interesting changes or additions. Anyone else have a favourite?</p>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2009</span>

    <p>Asteroid is a simple web interface for running scripts and recording the results. It&#8217;s like a much simpler and more general purpose version of something like Cruise Control. You can <a href="http://github.com/garethr/Asteroid/tree/master">get the code on Github</a>.</p>

<p>I built it to solve two main problems:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&#8217;s sometimes useful to have a historical record of a scripts execution, in particular whether it passed or failed and what the output was. Just running a command line script probably doesn&#8217;t give you that. It&#8217;s also useful to have a more graphical interface for those members of the team who don&#8217;t use the command line.</li>
	<li>When working in a team you often want to run scripts against shared infrastructure, for instance deploying a testing release or running a test suite. Seeing what is running at present helps with that.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it should be useful for running deployments, running test suites, running backups, etc. It currently doesn&#8217;t have scheduling or similar build in, but as everything is triggered by hitting a <span class="caps">URL</span> it would be simple enough to use cron for something like that. It should also be useful whatever language you write your scripts in; rake, ant, shell scripts, etc. At the end of the day it just executes a command at the console.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Asteroid uses the Django Python framework under the hood.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Django &#8211; <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">http://www.djangoproject.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need a database. The default in the shipped settings is to use sqlite but this should work with any database supported by Django.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also need a decent web browser. I&#8217;ve gone and used HTML5 as an experiment and with this being a developer tool I&#8217;m hoping to stick with it. It would be easy enough to convert the templates if this is a problem however.</p>
<p>The application has an optional message queue backend which can be enabled in the settings file. This is used to improve the responsiveness of the application as well as allow commands to be executed on a remote machine, rather than on the box Asteroid is running.</p>
<ul>
	<li>AMQPlib &#8211; <a href="http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/">http://barryp.org/software/py-amqplib/</a></li>
	<li>RabbitMQ &#8211; <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">http://www.rabbitmq.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Other <span class="caps">AMQP</span> compliant message queues should work but it&#8217;s currently only tested with Rabbit.</p>
<p>If you are intending to do any development on Asteroid, or just want to look more closely at the code, I&#8217;d recommend installing</p>
<ul>
	<li>Clue &#8211; <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-clue/tree/master">http://github.com/garethr/django-clue/tree/master</a></li>
	<li>Test Extensions &#8211; <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions/tree/master">http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions/tree/master</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
<p>You should be able to just download asteroid and run it from wherever you put it, once you setup the database.</p>
<pre>cd asteroid/configs/common
manage.py syncdb
manage.py runserver</pre>
<p>This should bring the local web server up on port 8000 so visit http://localhost:8000 and see.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using the message queue backend you&#8217;ll need to run the listener script in order to get your commands executed. At the moment that means modifying a constant in the listener script to point at a running message queue instance at asteroid/bin/asteroid_listen.py.</p>
<pre>cd asteroid/bin
./asteroid_listen.py</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;re up and running you should be able to add commands via the admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin/. The username and password should be those you added when creating the database via the syncdb command above.</p>
<p>The development configs include a few additional applications (mentioned above) which I use for testing and debugging. You can run the test suite like so:</p>
<pre>cd asteroid/configs/development
manage.py test --coverage
</pre>
<h2>Todo</h2>
<p>This is an early release that just about <em>works for me</em>. I can already see a number of areas I&#8217;d like to clean up a little or extend. For instance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Other deployment options, including a <span class="caps">WSGI</span> file and a spawning startup script.</li>
	<li>Use a database migration system to make upgrades easier.</li>
	<li>Make the message queue listener script more robust.</li>
	<li>Make the command entry more robust, it sometimes takes a bit of fiddling with to get something to run correctly.</li>
	<li>Formalise running scripts on remote machines, including support for running on multiple machines.</li>
	<li>Paging for long lists of commands or runs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty happy with how it&#8217;s shaping up so far. Under the hood it works by having the web app put a <span class="caps">JSON</span> document on the message queue. The <span class="caps">JSON</span> contains the command to be run and a callback <span class="caps">URL</span>. The script listening to the message queue picks up the message, runs the command, and posts a <span class="caps">JSON</span> document back to the webhook url. It keeps the web interface snappy, as well as meaning it can show which commands are currently in progress at any given time. It also has the side benefit of meaning you can execute commands on a remote machine, as the listener doesn&#8217;t care where it&#8217;s running.</p>
<p>As noted above I have a few ideas of where I want to take it, but I&#8217;m going to try using it for a bit and see how that goes. If anyone else finds it useful then do let me know.</p>
