    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad</a> I&#8217;ve just released a new version of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-test-extensions/0.5">Django Test Extensions</a> (also on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions">GitHub</a> with support for running tests without the overhead of setting up and tearing down the database. Django still has a few places were it assumes you&#8217;ll have a database somewhere in your project &#8211; and the default test runner is one of them.</p>

        Automating web site deployment at Barcamp Brighton
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>On the first day at Barcamp Brighton this year I did a brief talk about getting started with automating deployment. I kept it nice and simple and didn&#8217;t focus on any specific technology or tool &#8211; just the general principles and pitfalls of doing anything manually. You can see the &#8220;slides on Slideshare&#8221;:</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=automatingdeployment-090906054723-phpapp01&stripped_title=automating-web-site-deployment" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=automatingdeployment-090906054723-phpapp01&stripped_title=automating-web-site-deployment" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>As part of the presentation I even did a live demo and promised I&#8217;d upload the code I used. The following is an incredibly simple fabric file that has most the basic set of tasks. <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fabric/">Fabric</a> is a python tool similar to capistrano in Ruby. I don&#8217;t really care whether you&#8217;re using make, ant, rake, capistrano or just plain shell scripts. Getting from not automating things to automating deployments is the important part &#8211; and it&#8217;s easier that you think.</p>
<script src="http://gist.github.com/181755.js"></script><p>The other part of the code example was a very basic apache virtualhost so just in case anyone needed that as well here it is:</p>
<pre>&amp;lt;VirtualHost *:80&amp;gt;
    ServerName sample.local
    DocumentRoot /srv/sample/releases/current
    &amp;lt;Directory /srv/sample/releases/current&amp;gt;
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    &amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;
    ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/sample/error.log
    LogLevel warn
    CustomLog /var/log/apache2/sample/access.log combined
&amp;lt;/VirtualHost&amp;gt;</pre>

    <p><a href="http://djugl.eventwax.com/djugllondon-python"><span class="caps">DJUGL</span></a> is back, the <em>monthly</em> Django meetup in London. I think the last few times have been as much about useful Python stuff as just using Django, and this time it&#8217;s officially a bit more broad ranging. If you&#8217;re in or around London on the 24th September then come along.</p>
<p>You can get more information on <a href="http://twitter.com/londonpython">Twitter</a> or by following <a href="http://twitter.com/robertlofthouse/">Rob</a>. But expect a few short talks, some interesting conversations and maybe some beer with other like minded developers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be talking about automating deployment of Python web applications. If you follow me on Twitter you&#8217;ll have heard me rambling a little about some of what I&#8217;ve been up to, and some of the posts here give an insight into what I&#8217;ve been working on. But the short version is that several friends mentioned how difficult it could be to get a working Django application from a local machine to a production web server. And I though I better get down in script form my experiences of Django, <span class="caps">WSGI</span> applications and web server setup to make things easier.</p>
<p>I think this situation is partially caused by the success of the Django development server, and partially by people coming from a <span class="caps">PHP</span> background. In my <span class="caps">PHP</span> days I think I always wanted to know how Apache did it&#8217;s think, so long ago jumped into anything and everything in httpd.conf from loading modules to virtual hosts. But not everyone does the same, and <span class="caps">PHP</span> does make simple deployments easy enough that you might get away without doing so. Rails went through the same problems and seems to be coming out the other side. I&#8217;m hoping that Django and Python is soon to be in the same position, where basic deployment is just a given.</p>

        Django and WSGI deployment on Solaris
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m generally an Ubuntu guy, but I&#8217;ve just had the need to setup some boxes running Solaris for Django and a handful of <span class="caps">WSGI</span> applications. I know my way around Ubuntu pretty well. I know all the packages I need to install and in what order. Hell, I even have all that scripted so I can just run a command and it works by magic. I&#8217;ll script the following steps if I can do when I get round to it but here, in one list, are the installation instructions for Apache, mod_wsgi, Mysql, MySQLdb, setuptools and memcached that worked for me on the latest version of <a href="http://www.opensolaris.com/">Open Solaris</a> (2009.06 at the time of writing).</p>
<p>First up I needed to install Apache and start the service running.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWapch22
svcadm enable http:apache22</pre>
<p>You should be able to test that&#8217;s running by hitting localhost on a browser running on the same box. Now for MySQL.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmysql5
svcadm enable mysql:version_50</pre>
<p>This installs the mysql binary into /usr/mysql/5.0/bin/mysql on the system I&#8217;m working on. As I want to talk to the MySQL database server using Python I need to install MySQLdb.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmysql-python
ln -s /usr/mysql/5.0/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient_r.so.15 /usr/lib/libmysqlclient_r.so.15</pre>
<p>This installs the library files into /usr/mysql/5.0/lib and Python doesn&#8217;t know were to find them. The above command links them into the more standard /usr/lib folder were Python will pick it up nicely.</p>
<p>I tend to use <a href="http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/">mod_wsgi</a> for serving Python apps behind Apache,  however a mod_wsgi package isn&#8217;t part of the default package list. It is however available in the pending list so first you need to add that list of packages.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg set-authority -O http://pkg.opensolaris.org/pending pending
pfexec pkg refresh
pfexec pkg install mod-wsgi</pre>

<p>This installs the module but you then need to tell Apache to load it. Add the following line to /etc/apache2/2.2/conf.d/modules-32.load or /etc/apache2/2.2/conf.d/modules-64.load depending on your architecture.</p>
<pre>LoadModule wsgi_module    libexec/mod_wsgi.so</pre>
<p>To get Apache to load that module you need to restart it like so:</p>
<pre>svcadm restart http:apache22</pre>
<p>I use <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip">Pip</a> for installing Python code, but tend to install setuptools to make installing Pip easier. I don&#8217;t know if an up to date Pip package exists.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install python-setuptools</pre>
<p>This should leave you with easy_install on your path so installing Pip, then virtualenv should be a breeze.</p>
<p>As an added bonus I also installed memcached for some snappy caching.</p>
<pre>pfexec pkg install SUNWmemcached</pre>
<p>This won&#8217;t start up by default and needs a little configuration. The first command will launch you into a prompt where you can type the rest of the commands.</p>
<pre>svccfg
svc:&gt; select memcached
svc:/application/database/memcached&gt; setprop memcached/options=("-u" "nobody")
svc:/application/database/memcached&gt; quit</pre>
<p>Once you&#8217;d done that you should be able to start memcache on the standard port.</p>
<pre>svcadm refresh memcached
svcadm enable memcached</pre>
<p>Et voila. The internet helped massively on my quest to track down this information. Not all of the following links turned out to work for me but all of them led me in the right direction. Thanks everyone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a Solaris admin. I&#8217;m not really a sysadmin at all, I just end up pretending to be one of late. Any experienced Solaris people with experience of these tools reading this I&#8217;d be grateful for any hints and tips. Hopefully this saves a few people from the head scratching I&#8217;ve been doing for the last few days.</p>

      <a href="/2009/08/15/your-own-pypi-server/">
        Your Own PyPi server
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Aug 2009</span>

    <p>So one of the problems with using pip or easy_install as part of an automated deployment process is they rely on an internet connection. More than that, they rely on PyPi being up as it&#8217;s a centralised system, unlike all the apt package mirrors.</p>
<p>The best solution seems to be to host your own PyPi compliant server. Not only can you load all the third party modules you use onto it, but you could also upload any internal applications or libraries that you like. By running this on your local network you ensure your not dependent on pypi or an internet connection.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;m playing with <a href="http://github.com/ask/chishop/tree/master">Chishop</a> which is a django application for maintaining a PyPi compatible server. Another alternative if that doesn&#8217;t work out is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/EggBasket/">EggBasket</a></p>
<p>To install from your own PyPi server you can specify the location of your Chishop instance with the -i flag.</p>
<pre>easy_install -i http://localhost:8000/ PACKAGE_NAME</pre>
<p>This will fall back to the PyPi server if it doesn&#8217;t find the relevant package. If you want to stop that behaviour and make sure you have a local package then you can limit the hosts with the -H flag like so.</p>
<pre>easy_install -H localhost:8000 -i http::/localhost:8000/ PACKAGE_NAME</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m not yet sure how to do this with pip, if someone wants to enlighten me in the comments then I&#8217;d be most grateful.</p>
