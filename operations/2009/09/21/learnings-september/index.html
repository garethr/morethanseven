  <h1 class="post-title">Learnings from September</h1>
  <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2009</span>
  <p>I&#8217;m keep meaning to get around to writing about why I think the future of web developers is operations but in lieu of a proper post here&#8217;s a list of things I&#8217;ve been spending my work life getting to know this month:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet">Puppet</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s brilliant. Define (with a Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span> of course) what software and services you want running on all your machines, install a daemon on each of them, and hey presto central configuration management.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/">VMWare vsphere</a> &#8211; puppet makes more sense the more boxes you have. With vsphere I can have as many boxes as I want (nearly). Command line scripts and an actually very nice windows gui for settings up virtual machines is all pretty nice, especially running on some meaty hardware.</li>
	<li><a href="http://nagios.org/">Nagios</a> &#8211; With lots of boxes comes lots of responsibility (or something). Nagios might look a bit ugly, and bug me with it&#8217;s needless frames based admin, but I can see what people see in it. Which frankly is the ability to monitor everything everywhere for any change what-so-ever.</li>
	<li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m now also pretty well versed in using Solr. I&#8217;ve used it in the past, but always behind a Ruby or Python library. Now I know my way around all the <span class="caps">XML</span> based configuration inards. Heck, I&#8217;m even running a nighly release from a couple of days ago in a production environment because I wanted a cool new feature. A special mention to the Solr community on the mailing list, twitter and irc for being great when I had questions.</li>
	<li>Solaris &#8211; I nearly forgot, I spend more time than I care to remember working out how to use Open Solaris (conclusion: OK, but not Debian) and eventually Solaris 10 (conclusion: hope I don&#8217;t have to do that again). My installation notes read like some hideous hack but everything works fine in production and it&#8217;s scarily repeatable so I&#8217;ll live with it for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder if it&#8217;s just me that&#8217;s drawn to knowing how everything in the full web stack works. But personally I can&#8217;t just write code if I don&#8217;t understand how to deploy it or what it&#8217;s running on. Front end types know this all too well. Being a master of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Javascript simply isn&#8217;t enough. You need to understand the browser to get anything done. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the same for all backend inclined folk; how many <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmers really understand Apache and a few other useful bits of web tech?</p>
