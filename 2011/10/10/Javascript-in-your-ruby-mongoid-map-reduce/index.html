  <h1 class="post-title">Javascript In Your Ruby: Mongoid Map Reduce</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2011</span>
  <p>We&#8217;re pretty fond of <a href="http://mongodb.org/">Mongodb</a> at work and I&#8217;ve been getting an opportunity to kick some of the more interesting tyres recently. I thought I&#8217;d document something I found myself doing here, half hoping it might be useful for anyone else with a similar problem and also to see if anyone else has a much neater approach. The examples are obviously pretty trivial, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re making using of the rather nice <a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a> Ruby library for defining our models as Ruby classes. Here&#8217;s a couple of very simple classes. Anyone familiar with DataMapper or Django&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span> should be right at home here.</p>
<pre>class Publication
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :name,            :type =&gt; String
  field :section,         :type =&gt; String
  field :body,            :type =&gt; String
  field :is_published,    :type =&gt; Boolean
end

class LongerPublication &lt; Publication
  field :extra_body,      :type =&gt; String
end
</pre>
<p>So we now have a good few publications and longer publications in our system. And folks have been creating sections with wild amandon. What I&#8217;d like to do now is do some reporting, specifically I want to know the numbers of Publications by type and publication status. And lets allow a breakdown by section while we&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p>One approach to this is using Mongo&#8217;s built in map-reduce capability. Mongoid exposes this pretty cleanly in my view, by allowing you to write the required javascript functions (a mapper and a reducer) inline in the Ruby code. This might feel evil, but seems the best of the available options. I can see for much larger functions that splitting this out into separate javascript files for ease of testing might be nice, but were you can just test the input/output of the whole job this works for me.</p>
<pre>KLASS = "this._type"
SECTION = "this.section"

def self.count_by(type)
  map = &lt;&lt;EOF
    function() {
      function truthy(value) {
        return (value == true) ? 1 : 0;
      }
      emit(#{type}, {type: #{type}, count: 1, published: truthy(this.is_published)})
    }
EOF

  reduce = &lt;&lt;EOF
    function(key, values) {
      var count = 0; published = 0;
      values.forEach(function(doc) {
        count += parseInt(doc.count);
        published += parseInt(doc.published);
        type = doc.type
      );
      return {type: type, count: count, published: published}
    }
EOF

  collection.mapreduce(map, reduce).find()

end
</pre>
<p>In our case that will return something like the following, or rather more specifically it will return a Mongo::Cursor that allows you to get at the following data.</p>
<pre>[{"_id"=&gt;"Publication", "value"=&gt;{"type"=&gt;"Publication", "count"=&gt;42.0, "published"=&gt;29.0}},
{"_id"=&gt;"LongerPublication", "value"=&gt;{"type"=&gt;"LongerPublication", "count"=&gt;12.0, "published"=&gt;10.0}}]
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed with both Mongo and Mongoid here. I like the feel of mapreduce jobs for this sort of reporting task. In particular it&#8217;s suprising how writing two languages mixed together like this doesn&#8217;t really affect the readability of the code in my view. Given that with a relational database you&#8217;d probably be writing <span class="caps">SQL</span> anyway maybe that&#8217;s not that suprising &#8211; the syntactic differences between Javascript and Ruby are much smaller than pretty much anything and <span class="caps">SQL</span>. Lots of folks have written about the increase of polyglot programming, but I wonder if we&#8217;ll see an increase in the embedding of one language in another?</p>
