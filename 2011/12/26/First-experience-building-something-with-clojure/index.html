  <h1 class="post-title">First Experience Building Something With Clojure</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Dec 2011</span>
  <p>I nearly always try and grab some time over Christmas to try something new and this year I&#8217;d been planning on spending some time with Clojure. I have several friends who are big fans, but dipping in and out of a book hadn&#8217;t really worked. What I needed was an itch to scratch.</p>
<p>I stuck with a domain I&#8217;m pretty familiar with for this first project, namely building a little web application. It renders a web page, makes <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests, parses <span class="caps">JSON</span> into native data structures and does a bit of data juggling. Nothing fancy or overly ambitious, I was mainly interested in picking up the syntax, understanding common libraries and getting something built. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve got:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjBuAIM" alt="Dasboard for Jenkins builds"/></p>
<p>Jenkins has various <span class="caps">API</span> endpoints, but most dashboards I&#8217;ve seen concentrate on showing you the current status of all the builds. This is hugely useful when it comes to the simple case of continuous integration, but I&#8217;ve also been using Jenkins for other automation tasks, and making extensive use of parameterized builds. What the dashboard above concentrates on is showing recent builds for a specific job, along with the parameters used to run them.</p>
<p>Overall it was a fun project. Clojure made much more sense to me building this application than it had from simple examples. The <a href="http://webnoir.org/">Noir</a> web framework is excellent and proved easy enough to jump into and simple enough that I could read the source code if I was interested in how something worked. The <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a> build tool made getting started, downloading and managing dependencies and running tests and the application itself easy.</p>
<p>What I didn&#8217;t find particularly appealing was the lack of a strong standard library coupled with the difficulty of tracking down suitable libraries. <span class="caps">JSON</span> parsing, dealing with <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests and date handing are very common activities in web programming and all needed me to jump around looking at the best way of dealing with the common case. I settled on <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http">clj-http</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire">chesire</a> and using Java interop for date formatting. clj-http suffered from having lots of forks on GitHub to navigate through. I started with clojure-json before discovering it had been deprecated. And neither clj-time or date-clj appeared to support unix timestamps as far as I could tell from the source. Throw in some uncertainty over the status of clojure-contrib that isn&#8217;t well documented on the official site and it needs some effort to get started.</p>
<p>The working code for this is already up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/jenkins-build-list">GitHub</a> and I&#8217;d be interested in any Clojure experts showing me the error of my ways.</p>
