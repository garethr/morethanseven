  <h1 class="post-title">New Ganglia Web Interface Improvements</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2011</span>
  <p>So I&#8217;m a huge <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/">Ganglia</a> fan. It&#8217;s my go-to tool for standard low level metrics and for more ad-hoc higher level stuff as well. So I&#8217;m very happy to see the <a href="http://ganglia.info/?p=393">newly released</a> version of the Ganglia Web interface.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the old look and feel:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiZ8gEM" alt="Old Ganglia UI"/></p>
<p>And here&#8217;s the new version:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRix6gEM" alt="New Ganglia UI"/></p>
<p>The first thing that stands out to me is the wide range of new options. We have a navigation bar with items like search, views, agregate graphs, events and mobile. And we have dynamic date ranges, and filtering and sorting options for metrics.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Search is what you&#8217;d expect. A search as you type facility for hosts and metrics, great if you have a large cluster and want to find something quickly.</li>
	<li>Views are interesting. Basically a way of putting together a specific set of metrics on one screen and linking to them, rather than always having to go via the node or grid overview.</li>
	<li>You could always create agregate graphs in Ganglia, but you had to delve into writing some <span class="caps">PHP</span> to get what you wanted. Not you can do certain types of graph on the fly, simply by specifying what you want.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m cheating slightly here and using the very latest code rather than the 2.0.0 release. But it&#8217;s worth it for the Events feature. Events gives you the ability to record events like a deploy or a daily backup onto your graphs, immediately making some types of diagnosis easier. More about how I&#8217;m using this when I finish automating it.</li>
	<li>Gnaglia always worked OK on a mobile device mainly because all you really wanted was the graphs. The new mobile UI however just makes navigating much easier. It&#8217;s not yet doing device detection and automatically redirecting my iphone to that view which would be nice but it&#8217;s definately a good addition.</li>
	<li>Combined with views, automatic rotation shows a series of graphs, one every 30 seconds. Particularly useful for big screen dashboards, in fact I&#8217;ve built this exact feature before more than once before.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve concentrated here on the new visual features, but the new UI also contains <span class="caps">CSV</span> and <span class="caps">JSON</span> output for all metrics as well as a much easier <span class="caps">JSON</span> based approach to defining custom metrics. The amount of stuff in this release is huge. Massive thanks to the folks behind all the new features, in particular <a href="http://vuksan.com/">Vladimir Vuksan</a>.</p>
<p>Ganglia is such a staple that I&#8217;m used to just using whatever is in the latest distro provided packages. When it comes to the web UI however I&#8217;m going to make an exception from now on. Not only can you run the new UI in parallel with the old, deployment is simply copying a directory into place (It&#8217;s easy to forget just how simple <span class="caps">PHP</span> deployment is sometimes). If you&#8217;re already using Ganglia spend a few minutes installing the new UI. If you&#8217;ve rejected Ganglia previously because it didn&#8217;t have one feature or another then now is the time to look again.</p>
