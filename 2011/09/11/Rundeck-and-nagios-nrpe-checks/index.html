  <h1 class="post-title">Rundeck And Nagios Nrpe Checks</h1>
  <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2011</span>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://rundeck.org/">Rundeck</a> recently. For those that haven&#8217;t seen it yet it&#8217;s an application for running commands across a cluster of machines and recording the results. It has both a command line client and a very rich web interface which boths allows you to trigger commands and shows the results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played with a few different jobs so far, including triggering Puppet runs across machines triggered by a Jenkins plugin. I&#8217;ve also been looking at running all my monitoring tasks at the click of a button (or again as part of a smoke test triggered by Jenkins) and I thought that might make a nice simple example.</p>
<p>My checks are written as Nagios plugins, and run periodically by Nagios. I also trigger them manually, using Dean&#8217;s <a href="http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html"><span class="caps">NRPE</span> runner script</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiJoQIM" alt="Rundeck showing a job output"/></p>
<p>The above shows a successful run across a few machines I use for experimenting with tools. Hopefully you can see the summary of the run on each of the four machines, each ran five <span class="caps">NRPE</span> checks and all passed. On failure we&#8217;d see the results as well as different symbols and colous. We can easily save the output to a file if we need to, rerun or duplicate the job (maybe to have it run against a different group of machines) or we can export the job definition file to load into another instance.</p>
<p>The same job can also be run on the command line (which makes use the of Rundeck <span class="caps">API</span>)</p>
<pre>./run -j "Run NRPE checks" -p PRGMR</pre>
<p>This example shows running a specific pre-defined job, but it&#8217;s also equally possible to fire of adhoc commands to some or all of the machines rundeck knows about.</p>
<p>One thing in particular that I prefer about this approach to say using Capistrano or Fabric for remote execution tasks is that you have a centralised authentication and logging capability. It would be easy enough to encapsulate the jobs into cap or fabric tasks (and manage that in source control) which means you&#8217;re not stuck if Rundeck isn&#8217;t available.</p>
