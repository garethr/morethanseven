        New Version of Radiant CMS Out Today
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>Via <a href="http://github.com/radiant/radiant/tree/master">tagging a new release</a> on GitHub I see a new version of <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a> (0.7) has been released. Radiant is a really nice <span class="caps">CMS</span> for smaller projects, it&#8217;s used on the official <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> site and I used it here at one point.</p>
<p>Go check out the <a href="http://radiantcms.org/blog/archives/2009/02/07/radiant-0-7-0---intaglio-release-final/">blog post for the full list of the changes</a>.</p>

        Hosting Images on App Engine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I like adding images to the occasional blog post but don&#8217;t do it as often as I want to. The reason being I can hardly ever be bothered to resize images. It means opening up a memory hogging application, fiddling around for a few minutes and then saving it out somewhere, then uploading said image to my server. All of those things bore me.</p>
<p>Appengine to the rescue. As an excuse to play around with the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/overview.html">image <span class="caps">API</span></a> as well as add more pictures to this here blog I decided to build myself a small image hosting application. I really only care about the two things noted above; resizing and uploading. If I can do that in one go I&#8217;m happy.</p>
<p>A couple of train rides (all the best code gets written on train journeys, fact) later and I&#8217;ve deployed the first version of Image Host which looks a little something like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjtBww" alt="Image Hosting interface on Google App Engine"/></p>
<p>(And yes that image is an image of image-host hosted on image-host. If you&#8217;re thinking <em>what image?</em> then it means this experiment isn&#8217;t working at the moment.)</p>
<p>The application is designed in such a way as you could have as many people uploading and managing their own set of images as you want, all within one instance. The only reason I don&#8217;t just open it up to any google user account is that it would eat into my quotas if it got popular and I have no interest in policing whatever dubious images anyone might upload.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with App Engine quite extensively of late. I really appreciate the <span class="caps">SDK</span> and the limited, but well designed and thought out APIs and testing stubs. At the moment I&#8217;m happy with where it&#8217;s at. It&#8217;s obviously early days but in my mind all I really want are APIs for offline processing, some sort of message queuing facility, <span class="caps">XMPP</span> support and a payment model for raising the limitations. And several of those are already slated for the near future.</p>
<p>If anyone wants to host their own version you can grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-image-host/tree/master">GtHub</a>. You&#8217;ll need your own App Engine account and your own snappy name but that&#8217;s all. If you really don&#8217;t want to do that, have a good reason to needing image hosting and ask nicely I might add more people to my version as well.</p>
<p>Their are a few bugs I&#8217;m going to fix when I get a moment,  a few documented limitations I know about and I&#8217;m still fleshing out the test suite to cover all the functionality. But all in all a worthwhile few hours spent hacking. I&#8217;ll probably get round to writing up some pointers for testing App Engine code as well as their are a host of gotchas and the only real documentation at present is comments in the code.</p>

    <p>The Python core developers are currently <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0374/">discussing whether to move away from <span class="caps">SVN</span> to a distributed version control system</a>. It&#8217;s a worthwhile read for anyone involved in this sort of decision in any capacity. It features hands on examples of each of the contenders (Bazaar, Git and Mercurial), some interesting observations about all of them as well as  some benchmarks against a mature codebase. Lots of conversations keep cropping up on Twitter about why bother switching to Git or other distributed systems &#8211; this is a good place to start whether you use Python or not.</p>

        Sinatra Simple Example
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinarta</a> Ruby web development framework recently and building a <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">larger than usual Hello World Example</a>. It&#8217;s describes itself as <em>a <span class="caps">DSL</span> for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</em> (what is it about Ruby people and their obsession with calling everything a <span class="caps">DSL</span>?). In reality it&#8217;s a great little web framework. It deals with a minimal set of the things you really need to do as part of any application &#8211; <span class="caps">URL</span> handling and routing, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request and response handling, etc. It reminds me of <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> in it&#8217;s minimalist approach which is definitely a good thing.</p>
<p>The following example is the hello world given on the site</p>
<pre>require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end</pre>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t a million miles away from a web.py example:</p>
<pre>import web
urls = (
    '/', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())
class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        return 'Hello World'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()</pre>
<p>The only real difference is the separate mapping of URLs to views in web.py, which is closer to how Rails or Django do things.</p>
<p>Their is quite a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> already for Sinatra, including the start of a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html">book</a>. The code (as with all good code these days) is on <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master">github</a> for your forking pleasure.</p>
<p>As for what I&#8217;ve been up to I have a more advanced <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">Hello World</a> example up on GitHub. I&#8217;m wanting to get a running application that demonstrates all the basic features (except <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2008/04/11/dsls-for-html-and-css-the-future-or-just-plain-wro/"><span class="caps">HAML</span> and <span class="caps">SASS</span></a> support). So far I&#8217;ve got a simple bit of Rack middleware, several views demonstrating different url handling techniques, basic erb templates, before methods, configuration settings, error handling, decent unit test coverage, a rake file with a tasks for documentation, code coverage, etc. I&#8217;ve also got configuration files for running the application with <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and using <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">God</a>. I&#8217;m going to add some simple database connectivity in at some point (either <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> or <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, I haven&#8217;t decided yet) and play around with writing spec tests and a capistrano recipe file. All in it&#8217;s a nice way of learning something new at the same time as producing something that might be useful. Once I have the rest of the bits and pieces I might even right a full tutorial.</p>
<p>I think the sweet spot for these sorts of mini frameworks are small services or little applications that just sit their are run. Both <a href="http://integrityapp.com/">Integrity</a> and <a href="http://irclogger.com">IRCLogger</a> both use Sinatra for instance and I think it&#8217;s used for the <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GitHub WebHooks</a> as well. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing Google AppEngine is useful for in fact and Sinatra would likely be a closer fit that Rails if Google ever feel like adding Ruby support. Although it does depress me a little that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">top four items in the public issue tracker</a> are <em>I want my own language</em>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jsonpickle">Jsonpickle</a> is a Python library for serializing any arbitrary object graph into <span class="caps">JSON</span>. The advantage over something like simplejson is the <em>arbitrary</em> part, simplejson throws errors when you try and serialize some types of objects. I also prefer the jsonpickle <span class="caps">API</span> (encode, decode) over simplejson (dump, dumps, load, loads).</p>
