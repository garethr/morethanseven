        Internet? Check. @media. Check!

    <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2006</span>

    <p>Right. It might have taken an overlong trip to London but I&#8217;ve finally got a spare moment <em>and</em> internet access. All back to normal hopefully soon. (mmmm)</p>
 <p>Anyway&#8230; <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>! It was ages ago, then some magical time warp type thing happened and it&#8217;s June all of a sudden. And I cant wait. Which is fairly handy as I&#8217;ll shortly be heading out to the pre show party to meet at least some people I know (or at least vaguely recognise from somewhere, once, maybe) and hopefully some new faces, always a solid part of the conferences I think.</p>
 <p>Some of the things I want to do over the next couple of days, besides listen to alot of good stuff. (Rereading this I realised I just refered to Molly, Tantek,  Jeffrey, Eric and everyone as <em>good stuff</em>. This is likely to be something of an understatement. No offence intended!)</p>
<ul>
 <li>Take photos</li>
  <li>More SubEthaEdit note taking</li>
  <li>Eat food (You know who I&#8217;m <a href="http://cackhanded.net">talking</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">about</a>)</li>
  <li>Keep updating the syndicator thing</li>
  <li>Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup)</li>
</ul>
 <p>And I&#8217;ve no idea which sessions I&#8217;m going along to before you ask. I&#8217;m still pretending I can go to all of them to avoid the disapointment.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been doing all sorts of stuff I want to blog about; I&#8217;m doing a Masters type usability and testing certificate, playing with more <span class="caps">PEAR</span>, I&#8217;ve been having a play with <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeigniter</a> quite a bit as well, which is lovely (thanks <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a>) and have a couple more small apps in the oven. I also want to clean up a couple of olders ones (the mailing list, the feed syndicator, etc.) and still need to get round to writing a proper article. And that&#8217;s before @media, I dont want to thing how busy I&#8217;ll make myself after than once I get even more ideas.</p>
 <p>Oh, and apologies for the <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ical-schedule-for-media#comment">delay</a> in getting <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">the calendar</a> updated. And I&#8217;ve no idea why some people couldn&#8217;t find it with the search tool. Anyway, updated now, so at least people shouldn&#8217;t get lost tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to bare with me at the moment. I&#8217;m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I&#8217;m busy?</p>
 <p>I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).</p>
 <p>Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I&#8217;d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.</p>

    <p>I dont often just post links to things I find interesting. I try and warble on more about something or other that&#8217;s on my mind. However, being rather busy and coming across something that really stood out makes this here post different.</p>
 <p>I stumbled upon <a href="dabbledb.com">DabbleDB</a> the other day. Watched the <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/utr/">video</a>. Thought to my self &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty darn slick&#8221;.</p>
 <p>DabbleDB is, pretty simply, an online database. For everyone. Ever. The blurb from the site says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dabble DB combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information on the web</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>What does that mean? It&#8217;s basically MS Access, but better and available through a web browser. Too complicated you say? Too hard to grasp? Watch the video. Be impressed.</p>
 <p>One claim I&#8217;m interested in getting first hand experience of is the one regarding Spreadsheets. Most people use spreadsheets as light weight (ie. flimsy) databases, rather than the number crunching powerhouses they really are. DabbleDB seems an ideal replacement to the former, but what about the latter? I remeber seeing <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards&#8217;</a> playing with a <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/base/spreadsheet/">Javascript Spreadsheet</a> a while back.</p>
 <p>I have to say I haven&#8217;t used DabbleDB yet. I haven&#8217;t signed up for a one month trial because I know I wouldn&#8217;t have time to explore properly just now. Everything that I&#8217;m excited about comes from the video, the site and the attached blog. When (not if) I get round to having a proper look I&#8217;ll try and remeber to post something.</p>
 <p>Pretty much all your common desktop apps are <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">now</a> <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">available</a> <a href="http://www.writely.com">through</a> <a href="http://calendar.google.com">a</a> <a href="http://gmail.com">browser</a>, except crazy things like image editing. Oh and the browser itself. Now their&#8217;s an idea. A meta browser. Within your browser window open up several smaller windows, maybe using different rendering engines or setups running remotely?</p>

    <p>Tis about time for another meet up in sunny Newcastle. Pretty short notice but hey, the mailing list has called.</p>
 <p><strong>Thursday 25th of May</strong> it is</p>
 <p>We are aiming for <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=Pubs+in+NE1&#38;om=1&#38;latlng=54972784,-1612320,18338178544157676465">Tilly&#8217;s on Westgate road</a>. More info over on <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/78803/">Upcoming.org</a></p>
 <p>Already a good few people coming along so, if your in the general area, why not join us? If last time is anything to go by expect lots of people who either dont know each other or only know people by domain name discussing anything vaguely (and I do mean vaguely) related to the web.</p>
 <p>The way of recognising everyone, as always, is the carrying of a recognisable web related book. Extra points for something really geeky, or really large.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m hoping for some good banter and some ideas for the future. Hey maybe even making these a regular shindig? It would save us taking ages to decide when and where to meet. Though on the where bit I pretty impressed. Their seems to be a strong correlation between web people in Newcastle and proper beer. Speaking of beer, I heard a rumour that <a href="http://swoo.co.uk">Steve</a> was buying a round to celebrate his new design.</p>

        Python at Microsoft
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2006</span>

    <p>At work we mainly use Microsoft technologies, .<span class="caps">NET</span> and such like, for our development. As I mentioned previously I&#8217;m playing with <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> at the moment, and getting on quite nicely. With .<span class="caps">NET</span> being a framework, aimed at allowing a variety of different languages to access the same class library, I though</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I wonder if you can use Python with the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework?</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>The rather large <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000855/202-7885728-2282211">Programming Python</a> tome alludes to it being on the cards after the implementation of <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> but no more details than that.</p>
 <p>I came across a few dated references indicating that it was possible but, and mentioning very slow reference implementations, all of which didn&#8217;t bode too well. Then up popped <a href="http://ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> from an <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">article</a> by <a href="http://hugunin.net/">Jim Hugunin</a>. This looked like what I was looking for. But it looked unmaintained, the page not having been updated for a couple of years!</p>
 <p>But the story continued. Jim, having moved to Microsoft, was still working on IronPython and it looks like it&#8217;s moving forwards apace. The latest beta was released on the 20th of April and it looks like 4 more betas before a 1.0 release.</p>
 <p>This discovery makes Python appear even more interesting. A nicely designed, cross platform scripting language with full access to the might of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework and it&#8217;s own good looking web development framework in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>
 <p>So, for anyone else looking around for similar details here&#8217;s a brief list of up to date information:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Video of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20051110PythonJH/manifest.xml">Jim showing IronPython off</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IronPython">Python Wiki page about IronPython</a></li>
  <li>Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">WikiPedia entry</a> </li>
