        Python at Microsoft
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2006</span>

    <p>At work we mainly use Microsoft technologies, .<span class="caps">NET</span> and such like, for our development. As I mentioned previously I&#8217;m playing with <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> at the moment, and getting on quite nicely. With .<span class="caps">NET</span> being a framework, aimed at allowing a variety of different languages to access the same class library, I though</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I wonder if you can use Python with the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework?</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>The rather large <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596000855/202-7885728-2282211">Programming Python</a> tome alludes to it being on the cards after the implementation of <a href="http://www.jython.org">Jython</a> but no more details than that.</p>
 <p>I came across a few dated references indicating that it was possible but, and mentioning very slow reference implementations, all of which didn&#8217;t bode too well. Then up popped <a href="http://ironpython.com/">IronPython</a> from an <a href="http://www.python.org/pycon/dc2004/papers/9/">article</a> by <a href="http://hugunin.net/">Jim Hugunin</a>. This looked like what I was looking for. But it looked unmaintained, the page not having been updated for a couple of years!</p>
 <p>But the story continued. Jim, having moved to Microsoft, was still working on IronPython and it looks like it&#8217;s moving forwards apace. The latest beta was released on the 20th of April and it looks like 4 more betas before a 1.0 release.</p>
 <p>This discovery makes Python appear even more interesting. A nicely designed, cross platform scripting language with full access to the might of the .<span class="caps">NET</span> framework and it&#8217;s own good looking web development framework in <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>.</p>
 <p>So, for anyone else looking around for similar details here&#8217;s a brief list of up to date information:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Video of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdntv/episode.aspx?xml=episodes/en/20051110PythonJH/manifest.xml">Jim showing IronPython off</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/IronPython">Python Wiki page about IronPython</a></li>
  <li>Good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IronPython">WikiPedia entry</a> </li>

    <span class="post-date">08 May 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m quite a fan of mobile devices. I&#8217;ve got a <a href="http://www.palm.com/">Palm</a>, I had a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1773120.stm">Pogo</a> for jeepers. However, I dont really have a geek phone at the moment (long story) &#8211; I&#8217;m still using my K700i.</p>
 <p>While watching the last day of premiership football in a suitable venue I thought I might see about going to the cinema. With my trusty phone I <em>tried</em> to find what was going on. I waded through pages and pages. I did searches. It sent me round in circles more than once and I gave up more than once. I found some info. I tried to buy tickets. It failed to acknowledge the existence of first the cinema, and then the film.</p>
 <p>Someone asked me at a recent talk about how easy it was to make sites compatible with mobile devices and I said (something like) &#8220;pretty easy&#8221;. I&#8217;m not happy with that answer now, so I&#8217;m going to change the question. How easy <em>should it</em> be to makes compatible sites?</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/wap/wml_reference.asp"><span class="caps">WML</span></a> might not be sexy, but it&#8217;s still in use all over the place. Support for mobile style sheets for proper web browsing seems all over the shop, with hundreds of different browsers pulling every which way.</p>
 <p>Their are a host of IA issues that browsing on a mobile device brings up. A vast number of slightly new challenges to look at &#8211; and importantly a whole new way of confusing the user.</p>
 <p>It makes you think maybe we need a dominant browser in the mobile space? Something to occupy alot of the ground and for the other browsers to loath and persue endlessly?</p>
 <p>We also need some centres of best practice. I&#8217;m sure their are some out there. I just dont know where yet. Some references. A Mobile <a href="http://csszengarden.com">Zen Garden</a>. A good book or two to <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">review</a>. Any thoughts?</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s rebooting time people. First up a shameless plug for <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">my entry</a> this time around. In the spirit of <a href="http://screenspire.com">screenspire</a> here&#8217;s a full length picture for those that cant be bothered to visit the site proper.</p>
 <p><a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com"><img src="http://morethanseven.net/images/webdesignbookshelf.jpg" alt="Webdesign Bookshelf" /></a></p>
 <p>Only a couple of reviews up at the moment but we will be adding them as fast as out busy fingers can write them. Big thanks to <a href="http://mtpatto.com">Mathew Patterson</a> and <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nicola Dobiecka</a> for their assists here. Otherwise you would just be listening to my blatherings (a little like here then?)</p>
 <p>Anyway, let me know what you think. As with all such endeavours more features (and probably fixes) will see the light of day over the next few weeks and months. Once everyone else is up I&#8217;ll post my personal faves, along with everyone one else ever.</p>

    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>I do quite a bit of musing on the subject of <em>the community</em>. Lots of other people do similar, just a few of the groups I know about:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> (Ok, thats me again)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.southwestnewmedia.com/">South West New Media</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.brightonnewmedia.org/">Brighton New Media</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.skillswap.org/">Skillswap</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.thinkandadrink.com/">Think and a Drink</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.refreshdallas.org/">Refresh</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.multipack.co.uk/">Multipack</a> (sorry!)</li>
  <li><a href="http://geekup.org/">GeekUp</a> (and one I missed)</li>
</ul>
 <p>Conferences are massive as well. With <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Carson</a> going down a storm, <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> looking to rock the summer again and some people spoke highly of <a href="http://www.sxsw.com"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a>, but then I wasn&#8217;t there (this year).</p>
 <p>We all know each other. Think about it?</p>
 <p>We are like footballers. We are the Premiership. We hang out in the trendy bars (conferences), we do everything we can to get mentioned in the papers (A-list blogs, A List Apart) and we get multi million pound book deals (<a href="http://domscripting.com"><span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting</a>).</p>
 <p>But theirs a difference. Youth players (students), the lower leagues (Z-list) and amateurs watch football every week. They read about it every day online and in the papers. Everyone knows who the best players are, whether they like football or not. Even then thats before you get to scouts from the big clubs getting along to youth and lower league games to find the next big thing, or the World Cup. Web design still seems spit between those in the know (probably you) and those not, for whatever reason.</p>
 <p>So my question, if their is one, is &#8211; is football simply more mature? Do we need scouting systems? World Cups and better training facilities? Or alternatively have I taken this football analogy way too far?</p>

        A Proliferation of Feed Standards
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>Google just announced <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/overview.html">GData</a>, which is apparently a:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230;simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>It is basically an amalgamation of Atom, <span class="caps">RSS</span> and bits and pieces of Goodle juice. It piqued my interest for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What was termed <em>Optimistic Concurrency</em></li>
  <li>A promise of <em>Authentication</em></li>
  <li><em><span class="caps">REST</span></em> based</li>
</ul>
 <p>The former relates to a simple solution to the problem of concurrent updates. Say I grab a file and make a change, but in between another individual grabs the same file, and after I submit my changes, they also try top submit changes all my changes could be lost. GData specifies a solution to this by introducing version numbers, only if the version you are modifying has the latest version number will it be accepted. The version number is simply provided in the edit <span class="caps">URI</span> in the feed. Nice.</p>
 <p>I wont ramble too much about <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html"><span class="caps">REST</span>,</a> safe to say if you like URLs then it makes perfect sense and you can just get on with it. Lots of other posts about <a href="http://billburnham.blogs.com/burnhamsbeat/2004/12/rest_vs_soap_wh.html">why</a> if you missed the (ongoing) debate. It&#8217;s a bit like <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> and the Semantic Web. The bariers to entry for microformats are the the same as those for building web pages.</p>
 <p>I say the promise of Authentication above because it turns out that part of the system is not in place yet. The other part of that I&#8217;m sceptical about is, from my reading, a complete reliance on Google to provide the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/protocol.html#Authentication">authentication</a>. For some applications that&#8217;s fine, for others you probably dont want Google in charge of the keys.</p>
 <p>It also has simple proscribed methods of dealing with categories and search queries, including <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">Opensearch</a> integration.</p>
 <p>I was thinking about playing with a <span class="caps">PHP</span> based client/server for GData, or at least having a look, but I think I&#8217;ll wait until I know more about the authentication side.</p>
 <p>I have a feeling Microsoft will do something like this as well, take existing open standards and republish them with a few bells and whistles. And again the developers, ie. us, are left supporting multiple slight variations on a theme. Maybe I&#8217;m just suspicious. Time will tell.</p>
