        Textpattern!
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2005</span>

    <p>In something of a shock I&#8217;ve just ported the site (well some of it so far) to <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">Textpattern</a>. I&#8217;d alluded that I was looking to do something similar (I mentioned a crazy Ruby fueled idea, but strayed away after having a run in with fastcgi) a little time ago but have finally gotten around to it.</p>
 <p>The reasons where many fold, but mainly came down to wanting to do other things that write content management applications. I know I can do it, and it&#8217;s certainly not a solved problem, but it&#8217;s not as much a part of my job any more &#8211; every few months I was wanting to go back and rewrite something fundamental (or everything) and it was getting in the way of me doing other, hopefully more interesting and useful things &#8211; like <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> , <a href="http://morethanseven.net/fluidflash">Fluid Flash</a> or playing with whatever buzz word is in this week (definately <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web2.0">Web 2.0</a>).</p>
 <p>So after what was quite a brief look around I settled on Textpattern mainly for it&#8217;s positioning. It is a blogging ap, but has lots of other features that allow content management of other elements &#8211; hopefully useful for side projects and the like. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">PHP</span> and MySQL so I can rip it to pieces if I want. It&#8217;s mature, stable, feature rich and does, with plugins, everything I probably need &#8211; the big question will be if it does them in a way I like, so far it&#8217;s thumbs up. Oh and <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">John Hick&#8217;s</a> has written a number of really good articles on textpattern, including a <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/textpattern-migration">migration piece</a> which gave me some pointers.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve ported recent posts and comments, I&#8217;ll move the rest on an as time permits basis but, after some mod_rewriting mad skills I&#8217;ve kept the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/weblog/">old site</a> fully functional (no link rot &#8211; yeah).</p>
 <p>All in all it probably took me 4 hours, in a couple of sessions, to get all the styles into textpattern, set up a few plug-ins (del.icio.us links, live previews &#8211; whoo), port the latest content and move from my development box to here. A pretty good testament to the ease of use of textpattern. If I had not had the original design or content I would have been up and running in minutes &#8211; the installation process is smooth as a new cuddly toy.</p>
 <p>Their are a couple of changes that hopefully only the anal will even see. I&#8217;ll try and resurect some of them, probably in a more satisfying manner that before.</p>
 <p>For the moment I&#8217;ll keep the existing rss feed up to date but only for a little while, the new textpattern feeds can be accessed from the navigation menu, and now include an atom feed as well (basically because I can).</p>
 <p>In conclusion, anyone looking to move, or start, a blog style site with other ambitions then textpattern could be what your looking for &#8211; although some <span class="caps">PHP</span> skills wouldn&#8217;t go a miss.</p>
 <p>Anyway, here&#8217;s to a more organised life. Anything fundamentally wrong let me know!</p>

    <p>Peter J Lambert of <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">Pixelicious</a> fame has had a great idea. At least the best idea I heard today. Pretty short notice but if anyone fancies a trip down (or up?) to York for something of a geek get together let me know.</p>
 <p>I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m definately going as I just found out but decided to spread the word anyway &#8211; and with any luck will definately try and make the trip. I had been feeling (and I think I even complained once) about the lack of a sense of Northerness (not that southerners, or Scots for that matter, aren&#8217;t nice people or anything but&#8230;) amongst web design. Real Ale, Grit, Coal, that sort of thing &#8211; you just dont see that much web design that looks like it was inspired by that.</p>
 <p>Anyway, the 15th (Saturday) looks to be the date of choice. Head over to <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">pixelicious.co.uk</a> to express an interest or complain or find out more information.</p>
 <p>If anyone from around Newcastle does fancy it let me know as well &#8211; I&#8217;d probably be even more inclined to go and meet strangers if other strangers (or <a href="http://randomcat.co.uk">Chris</a>) who live and work near me where going.</p>

    <p>After <a href="http://andybudd.com">complains</a> of the lack of a decent magazine, and after the passing and resurection of Design in Flight another one raised it&#8217;s head. Yeh. Have a look at <a href="http://particletree.com/treehouse/">treehouse</a>.</p>
 <p>Another great, low cost ($15), well designed publication that you can print out and read in the moments away from the computer.</p>
 <p>OK, so I haven&#8217;t read that much yet but what I have was both interesting, informative and hey, pretty well edited.</p>
 <p>Thumbs up to any and all involved.</p>

        Are kids being taught web standards? II
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2005</span>

    <p>Disclaimer: I went to uni but not to study anything even remotely to do with the web. I basically make everything up as I go along. Bear that in mind when reading my commentry.</p>
 <p>Phil (<a href="http://xlab.co.uk">xlab.co.uk</a>) just made an observation regarding webstandards and education that I thought particularly interesting. Are kids being taught web standards?</p>
 <p>Based on my experience, limited as it may be, I&#8217;d have to vote no. I&#8217;d maybe even go further &#8211; are kids (sorry to any young readers, I&#8217;m just going with the flow) being taught web design?</p>
 <p>Web design, at least to my mind, involves a wide range of disciplines &#8211; Human Computer Interaction, Information design and theory, Graphic design, Application design and development and so on and so forth. Without a general appreciation of all of these you are not, again to my thinking, a web designer. That isn&#8217;t to say you aren&#8217;t a fantastic Graphic Designer or what not, but a web designer is simply a broader disciple.</p>
 <p>Back to education. And teaching. Now to teach such a rapidly changing medium? A course, I would imagine, needs planning over three years. The problem their is that in web design and development three years is an awful long time in terms of best practice and up to date thinking. I want to work with people who know <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, real world <span class="caps">CSS</span>, semantic thinking <span class="caps">XHTML</span> and unobtrusive Javascript. That sort of course simply could not have been written 4 years ago. And writing it now will leave it dramatically out of date in 4 years time &#8211; when all we&#8217;ll be wanting is more Python Programmers (or something)</p>
 <p>In a sort of unlikely to get picked up on sticking neck out statement, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;d love to help out. I see the only option is getting the local web industry involved in education. Seminars, chats, meet-ups, anything that get&#8217;s those in education nearer to the reality (yes &#8211; you do have to consider users other than your mates, tutors and design magazines) the better.</p>
 <p>Anyone else out their think the same? Willing to get involved? Maybe the time is now?</p>
 <p>Leave a comment here or on <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk/weblog/602">phil&#8217;s post</a> or post something on your site and lets discuss the issue. Does anyone else feel strongly about this? Even as someone not involved in the recruitment side of things directly at the moment I still want to work with the best &#8211; and in my mind so should everyone else.</p>

    <p>Ok. I just came to a realisation. I think somewhere along the line I got addicted. First I tried one. It seemed pretty good. Not really having any effect on my and generally just being good to feel part of something.</p>
 <p>But I couldn&#8217;t stop at one. I thought I could handle more and more. So I went in for some of the hard stuff. And lots of it.</p>
 <p>And look at me now. Typing this while waiting for more email that is reasonable for a small company in a week to download because I didn&#8217;t check my email for a day or so. Time for rehab I think.</p>
 <p>I dont want to chuck the habit completely, just pair back my addiction, get some control. So who stays and who goes?</p>
 <p>DiH (designersinhouse.com) is certainly leading at the moment as a keeper. It&#8217;s proved useful, interesting and informative so far &#8211; plus I met Matt at @media.</p>
 <p>I think maybe their&#8217;s room for one more. <span class="caps">CSS</span>-d, <span class="caps">WSG</span>, thelist, webdesign-L your time is coming.</p>
