    <p><a href="http://webpy.org">Web.py</a> is a really nice lightweight web framework written in Python. It&#8217;s not trying to be Rails or Django, it&#8217;s trying to be as simple as possible. Web.php is my homage to Web.py. I&#8217;ve unashamedly copied the ideas and build a very simple web framework in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It&#8217;s not a complete port, nor does it do everything in the same way.</p>
<p>The code example from the project home page was what originally piqued my interest:</p>

<pre><code>import web
urls = (
   '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
class hello:        
   def GET(self, name):
       i = web.input(times=1)
       if not name: name = 'world'
       for c in xrange(int(i.times)): print 'Hello,', name+'!'
if __name__ == "__main__": web.run(urls, globals())</code></pre>
<p>My <span class="caps">PHP</span> versions goes something like this, I&#8217;m sure you can see the similarities:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
require('webphp/web.php');
$urls = array(
   '/' =&amp;gt; 'hello',
);
class hello {
   function GET($path) {
      echo 'hello world';
   }
}
web::run($urls);
?&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it so far on a couple of projects, but it&#8217;s never been properly tested as such nor do I have lots of time to develop it. It&#8217;s purposely feature and code light (the core file is only 80 odd lines of code, includig comments).</p>

    <p>Having just moved from a couple of year old <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> site to <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> I didn&#8217;t feel much like copy and pasting lots of articles. The script simply copies all your posts from textpattern into the relevant place in Radiant.</p>

<p>At the moment this is undocumented and pretty rough but it saved me time and works. I&#8217;ll try and work up and potentially rewrite in Ruby for possible inclusion in the Radiant core if time permits.</p>

    <p>My first real foray into writing some simple Python scripts was a few scripts to establish the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning-Fog_Index">Gunning-Fog</a> index of some given text. I wont go into lots of details about the uses of such a script; if you&#8217;re interested read Gez Lemons <a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php">writeup</a> over on <a href="http://juicystudio.com">Juicy Studio</a>.</p>
 <p>I took quite a bit of inspiration, and some code, from a similar script, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pyflesch/?branch_id=57281&#38;release_id=191977">PyFlesch</a>, for establising the Flesch reading score of text.</p>
 <p>I expanded things a little, using the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module to parse content from <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds and give a Flesch or Gunning-Fog score of the summaries.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> from <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>. Although you <em>can</em> make pages public their is currently no way to style those differently, or to add content from outside Backpack. That&#8217;s where Backgarden comes in. It&#8217;s a simple <span class="caps">PHP</span> (4 and 5, the <span class="caps">XML</span>/<span class="caps">XSL</span> implementations are slighly different) application that builds a page via the Backpack <span class="caps">API</span> and some <span class="caps">XSL</span> magic that you can put on your site. You just enter the page address and your <span class="caps">API</span> key.</p>

    <p>Content management is one of those subjects I often get involved in at work, and something I find pretty interesting as a whole &#8211; even if I keep having to reiterate most of the problems with content management are people problems rather than technological ones.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> for this site and a few others for a couple of years. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the recent move to more hand rolled solutions, and the flexibility that gives people to innovate. As well as occasionally threatening to really kick the tyres on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> or similar (<a href="www.seaside.st">Seaside</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a>, &#8230;). I&#8217;ve been wandering the halls of the web development frameworks all year it seems &#8211; playing with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> along the way.</p>
 <p>To a point however these seemed more developer focused that something I could see being used by a web designer or small company (some intentionally so in fairness) or in education. However I&#8217;m back playing with Rails and started looking at existing apps to see how they are put together (I love open source) and a quick recce of Rails based <span class="caps">CMS</span> products turned up (amongst others that didn&#8217;t interest) <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a>. It <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2006/09/12/site-launch-at-last/">appears</a> to have been developed along side the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">new Ruby site</a> launched in September and boy is it a nice piece of kit.</p>
 <p>Assuming you have Rails installed, installation of Radiant is as simple as one command (It&#8217;s available as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Gem</a>) and then another to get a site up and running (Ok, plus a couple of other simple commands to configure a database). First impressions it looks well put together, with a strong concept well executed and a lovely Interface. It&#8217;s chunky without being cliched and simple without being simplistic. I&#8217;m in the process of making plans for next year and this is hopefully going to feature somewhere. I love looking for a problem where I might just already have the solution.</p>
 <p>Oh, and a only vaguely related note (well, <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> is a content management system of sorts) a couple of friends have started blogging over on <a href="http://breadlinedesign.com">breadlinedesign.com</a> and <a href="http://anotherblog.com">anotherblog.com</a>. Consider this a shameless plug.</p>
