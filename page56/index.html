    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Feb 2007</span>

    <p>Just back from <a href="//webdd.org.uk">WebDD</a> down in Reading at the Microsoft Campus and thought I&#8217;d post a few thoughts. I&#8217;ll get into a few of these topics in more detail down the line when time permits but for now&#8230;</p>
 <p>I went to a few talks, one on Microformats by <a href="http://www.glennjones.net">Glenn Jones</a> and the other on web standards design by <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk">Patrick Lauke</a> that I enjoyed but didn&#8217;t learn much. I wasn&#8217;t the intended audience really and I&#8217;d gone along because I didn&#8217;t fancy the alternatives. Both were entertaining and well attended anyhow, and I&#8217;m sure the more developer orientated folk got a lot out of both.</p>
 <p>The main two things I came away thinking about however were the upcoming version of <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700830.aspx">Visual Studio</a> (codename &#8220;Orcas&#8221;) and Microsofts new identity platform <a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">CardSpace</a></p>
 <p>Now I&#8217;m not generally a fan of IDEs, but someone has been thinking <em>alot</em> about how Visual Studio (and the new Expression Web) can be of use to web designers. Some of the <span class="caps">CSS</span> tools are very cool, I might do some screenshot from Expression (we all got free copies) if I get the chance. Their has also been a huge effort to integrate Javascript functionality, including full debugging and breakpoint support as well as intelissense. All of which looks really rather nice.</p>
 <p>According to Microsoft <q><a href="http://cardspace.netfx3.com/">Windows CardSpace</a> enables users to provide their digital identities in a familiar, secure and easy way.</q> Which should have alarm bells going off and (bad) memories of Passport flooding back. I went in not knowing much and in quite a sceptical mood, assuming the worst. Turns out I was wrong. The presentation, by <a href="http://www.idunno.org/">Barry Dorrans</a>, covered quite a bit of ground from an introduction, through code and working examples and even a big discussion of the issue of identity and <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> in particularly. I&#8217;m suprised that I haven&#8217;t seen any mention of CardSpace along with the recent rise in discussion around identity and OpenID. More on this soon.</p>
 <p>One last thing on the WebDD site caught my eye: <q>around 350 people with a 50/50 split of web developers and web designers</q>. In reality I think about 20 of us registered as designers which amused me. Microsoft doesn&#8217;t (yet) have a pull over designers as it does over developers. More on that too when I get my thoughts in order.</p>

    <p>Ok, well, that was interesting I thought. For those that haven&#8217;t followed along on the site I thought I&#8217;d recap some of the weird and wonderful colour schemes that have been used on this site as part of my experiment with <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/widgets/">colorburn</a></p>
 <p>Some were just about OK, some were quite nice really and a few were, er, pretty much unreadable (sorry). I&#8217;ll let you decide which where which:</p>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2007</span>

    <p>I do quite a bit of big picture web site/application design at work (ok, that probably needs more of a description). I get involved in alot of the details that lie somewhere off to the side of the obvious bits that need to be done (mmm, not much better). All those technologies and tools and ideas only tell part of the story of building a successful site or online application. Even something stringing together a good idea, clean markup, good <span class="caps">CSS</span>, some fancy backend code (insert prefered option) and a sprinkling of user centred design tools can fall down on the hidden details; good form labels, help messages that actually help rather than just repeating the problem, organising file systems to allow for simple scaling, skinning and internationalisation, etc.</p>
 <p><a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> spoke last year about his concept of <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/">Native to a Web of Data</a> which really struck a chord at the time, and not just because I still want <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/">this on a t-shirt</a>. More recently the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> has really caught on, especially amongst the dynamic languages crowd &#8211;  you just need to look at Rails 1.2 for an example their. The big picture is <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></a> is back and everyone who didn&#8217;t already get it should be doing some reading.</p>
 <p>Another notable person talking quite a bit about <span class="caps">REST</span>, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and related issues is <a href="http://bitworking.org">Joe Gregorio</a>. Amongst other interesting posts, I came across one on <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/URI_Templates"><span class="caps">URI</span> Templates</a> a good while ago and have been following the specification to produce recent documentation. The idea is simple and so is the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.html">specification</a>. A quick example, for a simple <span class="caps">CRUD</span> interface might be:</p>
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th><span class="caps">URI</span></th>
    <th>Method</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>View</td>
    <td>/view/{id}</td>
    <td>Get</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Add</td>
    <td>/page/add</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Edit</td>
    <td>/page/edit/{id}</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>/page/delete/{id}</td>
    <td>Post</td>
</tr>
</table>
 <p>Doing this for a site or application in the early stages of development really helps to highlight what actions are available, and to remove the need for costly changes later in the day. It also helps others learn, mainly through discussion, about the different <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods and the importance of the <span class="caps">URI</span> in general.</p>

      <a href="/2007/01/20/posting-to-twitter-using-php/">
        Posting to Twitter using PHP
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2007</span>

    <p><em>Please note that Twitter no-longer support Basic Auth via the <span class="caps">API</span> so the following code no longer works. Please see the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/oauth_faq">official docs</a> for more info</em></p>
<p>Like others I&#8217;ve found myself becoming something of a fan of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, the impossible to explain social networking site. If you&#8217;re reading this, have a twitter account and not already my <em>friend</em> then <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr">add me</a> if you like.</p>
<p>Apart from the interesting social aspects I&#8217;m also interested in Twitter as an <span class="caps">API</span> for all sorts of communications, remember Twitter already deals nicely with <span class="caps">SMS</span> messaging, Instant Messaging, subscription and the like and has a <a href="http://twitter.com/help/api">nice <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">JSON</span> based <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.zamano.com/">Zamano</a> <span class="caps">SMS</span> gateway at work for a few projects and Twitter actually lets me some more and doesn&#8217;t come with a price tag.</p>
<p>I started out playing with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> to send updates like so (obviously with a real username and password):</p>
<p><code>curl -u username:password -d status="twittering from curl" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml</code></p>
<p>I then used the <span class="caps">PHP</span> curl features to do the same thing from <span class="caps">PHP</span>:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
// Set username and password
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';
// The message you want to send
$message = 'is twittering from php using curl';
// The twitter API address
$url = 'http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml';
// Alternative JSON version
// $url = 'http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json';
// Set up and execute the curl process
$curl_handle = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_URL, "$url");
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 2);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "status=$message");
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "$username:$password");
$buffer = curl_exec($curl_handle);
curl_close($curl_handle);
// check for success or failure
if (empty($buffer)) {
    echo 'message';
} else {
    echo 'success';
}
?&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously you could do more with the return than print out a success or failure message. The $buffer variable has the returned <span class="caps">XML</span> or <span class="caps">JSON</span> for you&#8217;re parsing pleasure.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try out some of the other <span class="caps">API</span> methods too, probably play more with <span class="caps">XSL</span> or look more closely at the <a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=198"><span class="caps">PEAR</span> <span class="caps">JSON</span> module</a> in building up a simple library as a quick search didn&#8217;t throw up much of interest and the <span class="caps">API</span> is nice and simple; making it fun to hack on.</p>
