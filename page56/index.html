    <span class="post-date">24 Jan 2007</span>

    <p>I do quite a bit of big picture web site/application design at work (ok, that probably needs more of a description). I get involved in alot of the details that lie somewhere off to the side of the obvious bits that need to be done (mmm, not much better). All those technologies and tools and ideas only tell part of the story of building a successful site or online application. Even something stringing together a good idea, clean markup, good <span class="caps">CSS</span>, some fancy backend code (insert prefered option) and a sprinkling of user centred design tools can fall down on the hidden details; good form labels, help messages that actually help rather than just repeating the problem, organising file systems to allow for simple scaling, skinning and internationalisation, etc.</p>
 <p><a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> spoke last year about his concept of <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/files/native/">Native to a Web of Data</a> which really struck a chord at the time, and not just because I still want <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/">this on a t-shirt</a>. More recently the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> has really caught on, especially amongst the dynamic languages crowd &#8211;  you just need to look at Rails 1.2 for an example their. The big picture is <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></a> is back and everyone who didn&#8217;t already get it should be doing some reading.</p>
 <p>Another notable person talking quite a bit about <span class="caps">REST</span>, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> and related issues is <a href="http://bitworking.org">Joe Gregorio</a>. Amongst other interesting posts, I came across one on <a href="http://bitworking.org/news/URI_Templates"><span class="caps">URI</span> Templates</a> a good while ago and have been following the specification to produce recent documentation. The idea is simple and so is the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/URI-Templates/draft-gregorio-uritemplate-00.html">specification</a>. A quick example, for a simple <span class="caps">CRUD</span> interface might be:</p>
<table>
<tr>
    <th>Action</th>
    <th><span class="caps">URI</span></th>
    <th>Method</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>View</td>
    <td>/view/{id}</td>
    <td>Get</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Add</td>
    <td>/page/add</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Edit</td>
    <td>/page/edit/{id}</td>
    <td>Get, Post</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>/page/delete/{id}</td>
    <td>Post</td>
</tr>
</table>
 <p>Doing this for a site or application in the early stages of development really helps to highlight what actions are available, and to remove the need for costly changes later in the day. It also helps others learn, mainly through discussion, about the different <span class="caps">HTTP</span> methods and the importance of the <span class="caps">URI</span> in general.</p>

        Posting to Twitter using PHP

    <span class="post-date">20 Jan 2007</span>

    <p><em>Please note that Twitter no-longer support Basic Auth via the <span class="caps">API</span> so the following code no longer works. Please see the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/oauth_faq">official docs</a> for more info</em></p>
<p>Like others I&#8217;ve found myself becoming something of a fan of <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, the impossible to explain social networking site. If you&#8217;re reading this, have a twitter account and not already my <em>friend</em> then <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr">add me</a> if you like.</p>
<p>Apart from the interesting social aspects I&#8217;m also interested in Twitter as an <span class="caps">API</span> for all sorts of communications, remember Twitter already deals nicely with <span class="caps">SMS</span> messaging, Instant Messaging, subscription and the like and has a <a href="http://twitter.com/help/api">nice <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">JSON</span> based <span class="caps">API</span></a>. I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.zamano.com/">Zamano</a> <span class="caps">SMS</span> gateway at work for a few projects and Twitter actually lets me some more and doesn&#8217;t come with a price tag.</p>
<p>I started out playing with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a> to send updates like so (obviously with a real username and password):</p>
<p><code>curl -u username:password -d status="twittering from curl" http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml</code></p>
<p>I then used the <span class="caps">PHP</span> curl features to do the same thing from <span class="caps">PHP</span>:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
// Set username and password
$username = 'username';
$password = 'password';
// The message you want to send
$message = 'is twittering from php using curl';
// The twitter API address
$url = 'http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml';
// Alternative JSON version
// $url = 'http://twitter.com/statuses/update.json';
// Set up and execute the curl process
$curl_handle = curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_URL, "$url");
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT, 2);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POST, 1);
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, "status=$message");
curl_setopt($curl_handle, CURLOPT_USERPWD, "$username:$password");
$buffer = curl_exec($curl_handle);
curl_close($curl_handle);
// check for success or failure
if (empty($buffer)) {
    echo 'message';
} else {
    echo 'success';
}
?&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>Obviously you could do more with the return than print out a success or failure message. The $buffer variable has the returned <span class="caps">XML</span> or <span class="caps">JSON</span> for you&#8217;re parsing pleasure.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to try out some of the other <span class="caps">API</span> methods too, probably play more with <span class="caps">XSL</span> or look more closely at the <a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=198"><span class="caps">PEAR</span> <span class="caps">JSON</span> module</a> in building up a simple library as a quick search didn&#8217;t throw up much of interest and the <span class="caps">API</span> is nice and simple; making it fun to hack on.</p>

    <p>If you visited the site previously since the Radiant move you might notice a new colour scheme. Come to mention it if you visit tomorrow, or the day after you should get a different colour scheme too.</p>
 <p>I mentioned that I planned on a few experiments around these parts and this is the first one. I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/widgets/">ColorBurn</a> from <a href="http://www.firewheeldesign.com/">Firewheel</a>. For those that haven&#8217;t seen it it&#8217;s a desktop widget that displays a new four colour colour scheme every day that looks a little something like:</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgColorBurn.jpg" alt="ColorBurn OS X Widget" /></p>
 <p>I often use it for inspiration for colour sets, or just to appreciate interesting colour combinations. This just takes it a step further. A little reverse engineering and I have a script (<span class="caps">PHP</span> this time, running from a cron job) that writes out a new stylesheet once every day with the colours from ColorBurn (using the magic of <span class="caps">XSL</span> if you&#8217;re interested). I&#8217;ve used an alpha transparency on the image to the top left of the page which might result in strange effects in browsers that I dont care about too much. Sorry, but I did warn you.</p>
 <p>I have a feeling that some days I&#8217;ll wake up and regret this experiment and others I&#8217;ll be pleasantly suprised. I&#8217;m not going to cheat either. ColorBurn provides me with four colours and the script will use them in the order they come in.</p>

        OPML Feeds using Radiant
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2007</span>

    <p>As mentioned when I moved the site over to Radiant I promised a few tutorials and behind the scenes footage of goings on. So here goes with a quick look at how I added a nice <a href="http://morethanseven.net/friends.opml"><span class="caps">OPML</span> feed</a> to my site.</p>
 <p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.opml.org/"><span class="caps">OPML</span></a> it&#8217;s an <span class="caps">XML</span> format for outlines, often used for storing blog rolls and the like.</p>
 <p>What I wanted was a friends parent and the ability to add friends to it and for them to appear in a dynamic <span class="caps">OPML</span> feed. The following screenshot shows what I ended up with:</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeed.png" alt="Tree showing Friends feed in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>To accomplish this within Radiant I needed a custom layout, one which would simply render the content but also had the relevant header and footer markup. Note the mime type setting as well.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpmlLayout.png" alt="Layout for OPML in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Next up is the page which actually uses the <span class="caps">OPML</span> layout to render the page.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeedCode.png" alt="friends feed from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Note that I set the status of all the friends records to hidden, and then set the status of the r:children:each loop to search for hidden children. This way the individual friends records dont show up as seperate pages.</p>
 <p>All I need to do then is add children to the parent, friends-feed in my case. I added a few page parts to each friend page to make management a little easier; a <em>link</em>, a <em>feed</em> and for a little added spice <em>xfn</em>.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEditFriend.png" alt="Edit friend view from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>All in all it makes adding and updating friends easy, and the general approach will work with pretty much any content where you want to compose a single page based on it&#8217;s children.</p>
