        Erlang Screencasts
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to learn Erlang for a while. What I actually mean is it&#8217;s been on my list of <em>things to learn</em> for months, along with all sorts of other incredibly interesting bits and pieces. I spend a little bit of time at home but the majority of my learning time is now spent commuting to London and back most days. Sometimes I&#8217;m even going all the way to Swindon which gives me even longer to not learn Erlang.</p>
<p>The main problem with learning something new on the train is space. Reading a book (or my new Kindle) or just using my laptop is fine. Trying to do both at once is nearly impossible (I&#8217;ve tried). So I&#8217;ve decided to give another approach a try, namely screencasts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only done the first <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">Erlang in Practice</a> episode so far but I was hugely impressed with the content and general presentation. $5 as well doesn&#8217;t seem bad at all I don&#8217;t think. The episode was half an hour long, but took me a little longer, probably closer to 45 minutes, as I was playing along at home and typing the code examples as I went. I also got sidetracked with messing with my vim configuration at the same time but hey. This makes them perfect for my hour long commute. The full series is 8 episodes long and with luck I&#8217;ll be able to work through them this week.</p>
<p>So, good job <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Pragmatic</a> for a nice, accessible start to Erlang. All I need to do now is find something interesting to hack on in Erlang.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been lurking on the django-developers mailing list for the last couple of weeks and that provided an excuse to play with the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html">new Twitter Lists</a> feature.

        Problems Installing Hadoop 0.20 and Dumbo 0.21 on Ubuntu
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Oct 2009</span>

    <p>The Hadoop wiki has a great introduction to <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_(Single-Node_Cluster)">installing this piece of software</a>, which I wanted to do to have a play with <a href="http://klbostee.github.com/dumbo/">Dumbo</a>. The Dumbo docs also have a good <a href="http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo/building-and-installing">getting started</a> section which includes a few patches than need to be applied.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dumbo can be considered to be a convenient Python <span class="caps">API</span> for writing MapReduce programs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not quite that simple, at least on Ubuntu Jaunty. Hadoop now uses Java6, but if you just follow the instructions on the wikis you&#8217;ll hit a problem when you run &#8216;&#8217;ant package&#8217;&#8216;, namely that a third party application (<a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a>) requires Java 1.5. Once you fix that, the build script will complain again that you need to install Forrest. Here&#8217;s what I did to get everything working:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install ant sun-java5-jdk</pre>
<pre>su - hadoop
wget http://mirrors.dedipower.com/ftp.apache.org/forrest/apache-forrest-0.8.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-forrest-0.8.tar.gz
cd /usr/local/hadoop
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/HADOOP-1722.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/HADOOP-5450.patch
patch -p0 &lt; /path/to/MAPREDUCE-764.patch
ant package -Djava5.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun -Dforrest.home=/home/hadoop/apache-forrest-0.8/</pre>
<p>With all that out of the way you should be able to run the <a href="http://dumbotics.com/2009/05/31/dumbo-on-clouderas-distribution/">simple examples</a> found on the rather excellent <a href="http://dumbotics.com">dumbotics</a> blog. If you&#8217;re using the Cloudera distribution, or when the Hadoop 0.21 gets a release, these problems will disappear but in the meantime hopefully this saves someone else a bit of head scratching.</p>

    <span class="post-date">21 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m keep meaning to get around to writing about why I think the future of web developers is operations but in lieu of a proper post here&#8217;s a list of things I&#8217;ve been spending my work life getting to know this month:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://reductivelabs.com/products/puppet">Puppet</a> &#8211; It&#8217;s brilliant. Define (with a Ruby <span class="caps">DSL</span> of course) what software and services you want running on all your machines, install a daemon on each of them, and hey presto central configuration management.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/">VMWare vsphere</a> &#8211; puppet makes more sense the more boxes you have. With vsphere I can have as many boxes as I want (nearly). Command line scripts and an actually very nice windows gui for settings up virtual machines is all pretty nice, especially running on some meaty hardware.</li>
	<li><a href="http://nagios.org/">Nagios</a> &#8211; With lots of boxes comes lots of responsibility (or something). Nagios might look a bit ugly, and bug me with it&#8217;s needless frames based admin, but I can see what people see in it. Which frankly is the ability to monitor everything everywhere for any change what-so-ever.</li>
	<li><a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr</a> &#8211; I&#8217;m now also pretty well versed in using Solr. I&#8217;ve used it in the past, but always behind a Ruby or Python library. Now I know my way around all the <span class="caps">XML</span> based configuration inards. Heck, I&#8217;m even running a nighly release from a couple of days ago in a production environment because I wanted a cool new feature. A special mention to the Solr community on the mailing list, twitter and irc for being great when I had questions.</li>
	<li>Solaris &#8211; I nearly forgot, I spend more time than I care to remember working out how to use Open Solaris (conclusion: OK, but not Debian) and eventually Solaris 10 (conclusion: hope I don&#8217;t have to do that again). My installation notes read like some hideous hack but everything works fine in production and it&#8217;s scarily repeatable so I&#8217;ll live with it for now.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do wonder if it&#8217;s just me that&#8217;s drawn to knowing how everything in the full web stack works. But personally I can&#8217;t just write code if I don&#8217;t understand how to deploy it or what it&#8217;s running on. Front end types know this all too well. Being a master of <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span> and Javascript simply isn&#8217;t enough. You need to understand the browser to get anything done. I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s the same for all backend inclined folk; how many <span class="caps">PHP</span> programmers really understand Apache and a few other useful bits of web tech?</p>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2009</span>

    <p>Thanks to <a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad</a> I&#8217;ve just released a new version of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-test-extensions/0.5">Django Test Extensions</a> (also on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-test-extensions">GitHub</a> with support for running tests without the overhead of setting up and tearing down the database. Django still has a few places were it assumes you&#8217;ll have a database somewhere in your project &#8211; and the default test runner is one of them.</p>
