        Ant for Web Developers I - Backup Config File
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2009</span>

    <p>I occasionally get <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/01/24/defence-apache-ant/">carried away</a> with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>. For those that haven&#8217;t come across it, Ant is a build tool written in Java, using an <span class="caps">XML</span> syntax to describe a series of repeatable tasks. In your typical web standards savvy, dynamic language favouring, web developer types that description is probably all they (think they) need to know. It&#8217;s Java. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">XML</span>. It&#8217;s only really useful in the context of building software (dull).</p>
<p>But I think Ant is a particularly handy tool to have around for anyone working on even simple websites. A couple of strong use cases come to mind:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you&#8217;re working in a team environment then build files are hugely useful when introducing new people to the team, or when moving people around. Getting code up and running at the start of a project, or if you join the team part way through, can be tricky. A well written build file can automate this.</li>
	<li>Even when working on projects on my own I tend to write simple build files. The main reason is so I don&#8217;t forget how to do something. How do you deploy this particular site? How do you run the test suite or generate the documentation? Build files can encapsulate this, and rather than documentation that might be out of date the build file will be executed to do that job in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So with all that in mind I&#8217;m going to try and do a series of posts each covering a single task, aiming to cover things that your regular web developer will find useful. With that in mind if anyone has any requests or questions let me know either by email or in the comments.</p>
<p>Out first task lets us backup a file from our remote web server, in this case it&#8217;s the apache2.conf file used to setup apache. Obviously it could be any file you want to get hold of. The example below has a couple of properties for the username and hostname of the remote machine. Save the following snippet into a file called build.xml and place it anywhere you like on your machine.</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project name="example" basedir="."&gt;
&lt;property name="username" value="{user}"/&gt;
&lt;property name="host" value="{host}"/&gt;
&lt;target name="backup-apacheconf" description="backup apache2.conf file from a remote server"&gt;
  &lt;exec executable="scp" dir="." failonerror="true"&gt;
    &lt;arg value="${username}@${host}:/etc/apache2/apache2.conf"/&gt;
    &lt;arg value="apache2.conf"/&gt;
  &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>
<p>Running the task, once you have ant installed (it comes already installed on OS X and is generally available in whatever linux package management system you prefer), is as simple as typing the following into a console.</p>
<pre>ant backup-apacheconf</pre>
<p>This should download the apache2.conf file to you local machine, into the same directory as your build file.</p>
<p>The above task requires that you have scp installed on your machine, which is pretty likely if you&#8217;re using OS X or Linux. Ant comes with an inbuilt <em>scp</em> task, but it requires you to install a separate java library. If you&#8217;re happy doing that then you can write tasks like:</p>
<pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;project name="example" basedir="."&gt;
&lt;property name="username" value="{user}"/&gt;
&lt;property name="password" value="{password}"/&gt;
&lt;target name="backup-apacheconf" description="backup apache2.conf file from a remote server"&gt;
    &lt;scp file="${username}@${host}:/etc/apache2/apache2.conf" todir="." password="${password}"/&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

    <p>Ruby people <em>really</em> don&#8217;t like <span class="caps">CSS</span> do they? But <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> is actually pretty cool. It&#8217;s basically an attempt to bootstrap features, specifically Variables, Mixins, Operations and Nested Rules, into <span class="caps">CSS</span>. The best part about this is it uses <span class="caps">CSS</span> syntax and a simple one step compiler. I&#8217;d be interested to know what the folks at the W3C think about this.</p>
<p>So for instance you can do:</p>
<pre>/* LESS */
@brand_color: #4D926F;
#header {
  color: @brand_color;
}
h2 {
  color: @brand_color;
}</pre>
<p>and compile it down to:</p>
<pre>/* CSS */
#header {
  color: #4D926F;
}
h2 {
  color: #4D926F;
}</pre>

        Message Queues at Cambridge Geek Night
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2009</span>

    <p>Last night was the first Cambridge Geek Night and saw 35 people or so fill a room above a pub to listen to a few short talks and converse with fellow geeks. I had the pleasure of giving the first talk, a short introduction to using message queues for web developers.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>I got lots of good questions from interested people and by the sounds of things it had the desired effect &#8211; for people unfamiliar with using a message queue to go out and have a play with some of the cool software available to solve your problems.</p>
<p>Overall the night was definitely a success. Suitably geeky conversations. A chance to meet new people as well as old friends. Good job <a href="http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/">Vero</a> and <a href="http://blog.fatbusinessman.com/">David</a> for organising the event and here&#8217;s to the next one.</p>

        How to Decide on Your Next Programming Language
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2009</span>

    <p><a href="http://neilcrosby.com/">Neil Crosby</a> got me thinking yesterday about which language to learn/play with next by <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilCrosby/statuses/2090500164">tweeting</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so, lovely people of the interwebs. What webly language should I be spending my time learning then? Right now, I&#8217;m all about the <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil appears to have gone for Python, but more specifically I&#8217;m interested in how you decide what to learn next? And improving the likelihood of you seeing it through and being able to add it to you toolbox. Personally I&#8217;ve messed around with a wide range of languages but I would say I&#8217;m proficient in only a few of those.</p>
<p>So here goes with a list of questions to ask yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have a small pet project you can use the new language on straight away?</li>
	<li>Is the language increasing or decreasing in popularity?</li>
	<li>Does the language overlap with what you already know in terms of applicability?</li>
	<li>Is it a different style of programming to what you&#8217;re used to? Say a pure functional language if all you normally do is object orientated.</li>
	<li>Is the language in demand in the jobs market? If not why not?</li>
	<li>Could you use the language in your current job if you were allowed to?</li>
	<li>What are the learning materials like? Are there books or websites that teach the language without passing on bad practices.</li>
	<li>What is the community around a language like? Do they have an <span class="caps">IRC</span> room where beginners can ask questions without being mocked?</li>
	<li>Does the language have an interactive mode? Sorry but I find anything without to be a chore to learn.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of time? Remember some languages are bigger that others.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of money? Do you need specialist software, or hardware, or licenses?</li>
	<li>Do you have friends or acquaintances who use the language and who will help you out with pointing you in the right direction of resources or helping review your code?</li>
	<li>Do you have somewhere you can go to meet other people who write the language. That might be a formal user group or it might just be a more general pub meetup that you know a few people attend.</li>
	<li>How is the language represented on GitHub? Seeing what other people build and being able to read working code is hugely useful when learning anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think all of these apply to everyone or apply all the time, but it&#8217;s worth considering and rejecting them when they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Feel free to disagree in the comments or, even better, add extra ones. Or alternatively just cut to the chase and tell me what I should learn next.</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jun 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve updated my vanity domain at <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">garethrushgrove.com</a> with a bit of information in case anyone might be interested in my services.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjDPgw" alt="my personal site"/></p>
<p>The short version is I&#8217;m on the lookout for future projects, probably of a freelance or contract basis but if it&#8217;s particularly interesting then maybe a full time position. Basically I&#8217;m in quite a nice position and able to wander about a bit looking for something cool to do.</p>
<p>If you reading this site then you know what floats my boat. Python, testing, automation, system design, maybe get into Ruby or another language properly, etc. I&#8217;d particularly like to help people get started with testing, continuous integration or automated deployment and the like.</p>
