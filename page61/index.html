        Well, how did I do
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Dec 2006</span>

    <p>Well, the year is ever so nearly over. Again. I&#8217;m sure their will be a good few round ups, I&#8217;ll probably even partake <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/obligatory-next-year-post">again</a>, but thought I&#8217;d start off with a quick look at how I got on with my <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/more-to-comestatement-of-intent">list of stuff to do</a>.</p>
 <p>I did the conference thing again and I&#8217;m sure I will be back this coming year. <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2006/">@media</a>, <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a> and <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a> all look like going from strength to strength. And all being different enought to be worth going along. And I stayed awake throughout the Ajax workshops and I&#8217;m pretty sure I got to everything @media had to offer. So that&#8217;s three ticked off.</p>
 <p>On the article publishing thang. Well, I&#8217;m know writing for <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/">Vitamin</a> &#8211; doing book reviews as often as I can do, two so far on <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/reviews/coding/communicating-design-by-dan-brown/">Communicating Design</a> and <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/reviews/dev/using-microformats-by-brian-suda/">Using Microformats</a> and more to come. Hopefully more to come on that front too. Another tick I reckon.</p>
 <p>The next two, related to building and releasing stuff (specifically Rails and the feed syndicator) I sort of passed on. I actually have some things in the works but I&#8217;m not likely to get their this year. The reason was probably my flirtation with all sorts of other things &#8211; in particular Python. Releasing bits of code is something I&#8217;m going to do more of. Watch this space. Two crosses.</p>
 <p>Locally I messed up the domain name but settled on the nicer <a href="http://refreshnewcastle.org">refreshnewcastle.org</a> and with a little help from <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com/">Matthew <del>Patterson</del> Pennell</a> have a nice new site. Next year I want to do more than just web site related bits an pieces. Maybe half a tick?</p>
 <p>Now the &#8220;something vague&#8221; idea. Well, <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/teaching">teaching web design</a> at Newcastle College definately counts here I think. I didn&#8217;t see this coming and hopefully I&#8217;m doing a good job so far.</p>
 <p>Ok, so not bad going, but I could do better. And looking back over a list I made a year ago is quite interesting. I guess I&#8217;m posting this early to encourage anyone reading it to post a list of things they want to do next year. Anyone got any ideas?</p>

        Mac Virtualhost follow up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>A couple of people asked for the details of the virtualhost script I modified for use with <span class="caps">MAMP</span> in a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/virtualhosts-on-mac-os-x#comment">previous post</a>. Apologies for taking a bit of time.</p>
 <p>First I had to make these changes to the original <a href="http://patrickgibson.com/utilities/virtualhost/">virtualhost script</a>:</p>
<p><code>
DOC_ROOT_PREFIX="/Applications/MAMP/htdocs" 
</code></p>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;APACHE_CONFIG="/Applications/MAMP/conf/apache" 
APACHECTL="/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/apachectl"&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
 <p>I also made a few changes to httpd.conf in /Applications/<span class="caps">MAMP</span>/conf/apache. From memory first to allow local .htaccess files to override everything on a per directory basis.</p>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;Directory "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs"&amp;gt;
oAllowOverride All
&amp;lt;/Directory&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
 <p>and then to point to the virtual hosts directory.</p>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;NameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1
Include /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/virtualhosts&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
 <p>I keep meaning to do a screen capture tutorial of sorts, so maybe something like this would be a good starting point? We shall see as and when time permits. Probably this time next year. Any problems let me know and I&#8217;ll try and debug.</p>

        An Admission about Source Control
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>I have an admission to make; for personal projects, of which I have many, I haven&#8217;t been using source control until now. The reason? Probably laziness. I do lots of reading around the whole software development process but most of that gets used at work, at least until now.</p>
 <p>One of my favourite articles is the old <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Test</a>. Some of this is less relevant to the home developer, but it does give you somewhere to start from. Well, I&#8217;ve now got <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">subversion</a> up and running and all new projects will be going in their. I&#8217;ve already added the repository to my backup policy. The free book <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with Subversion</a> provided all the information I needed to get up and running. I&#8217;m more of a fan of command line interfaces anyway so haven&#8217;t installed any special interface. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll look into the <a href="http://www.macromates.com/">Textmate</a> integration once I know my way around the command line interface a bit more.</p>
 <p>Next up I&#8217;m on the lookout for something to use for bug tracking. I already use <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> and <a href="http://basecamphq.com">basecamp</a> for different activities but I&#8217;m not sure yet if they will do for proper bug tracking. I dont really like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">bugzilla</a>, although maybe <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">trac</a> is what I&#8217;m looking for?</p>
 <p>What does anyone else use, either for source control or bug tracking?</p>

        Teaching
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>Every now and again I go off on a tangent about the problems of learning, and teaching, web design. Recently I got an interesting email from a chap at <a href="http://www.ncl-coll.ac.uk/">Newcastle College</a> and just a few weeks later I&#8217;ve now taken a couple of sessions with students studying web design.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m doing 4 hours a week, alongside the day job. 2 hours of theory and 2 hours of practice. Teaching everything from research techniques, wireframing and sitemaps to the first steps on the road to <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> mastery.</p>
 <p>So far I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s going well (any students reading, please let me know if you think otherwise!) I thought a couple of observations would be handy at this stage, for those involved in doing the same, and for me looking back:</p>
<ul>
 <li>For someone not trained as a teacher, it&#8217;s too easy to take what you know for granted and go too quickly.</li>
  <li>It&#8217;s often hard to get across to new professionals how important the groundwork and theory is. With students this is doubly so.</li>
  <li> More structured techniques are a good idea for newcomers.</li>
  <li>The new <a href="http://htmldog.com">htmldog.com</a> site is an excellent reference. Thanks Patrick.</li>
  <li>Enthusiasm is priceless. Seeing enthusiasm I think &#8220;maybe I&#8217;ll end up working with them one day&#8221;, without it all the technical skills in the world wont get me excited.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Anyone else with a decent amount of experience and a little free time I&#8217;d recommend trying to do something similar. Our industry experience is a massively important part of the next generations educational needs and these are the people you&#8217;ll end up working with or managing in the future.</p>

        JRuby Vs Python.NET
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>I got to thinking recently, after playing around with more <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a> and talking with a Ruby fan, about the future of computer languages. Is their a war brewing between Python and Ruby in unexpected quarters? That quarter being the .<span class="caps">NET</span> and Java croud.</p>
 <p>Personally I&#8217;m too much of a fan of dynamic languages to be wholly impartial, but working in a mainly .<span class="caps">NET</span> shop I&#8217;m following IronPython when I get a chance, and a friendly Java officionando seemed pretty pleased with <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> (although why not <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html">Jython</a> I&#8217;m not sure?) when last I spoke with them.</p>
 <p>Java and .<span class="caps">NET</span> are the prime candidates when it comes to big companies buying software, and all of that investment isn&#8217;t going to go to waste any time soon. But the potential speed benefits of Python or Ruby, and the work already going on with the likes of JRuby, Jython and IronPython, could make for a smooth transition.</p>
 <p>I guess only time will tell, and I&#8217;m sure some people are still not convinced when it comes to dynamic languages (heathens). In the meantime I&#8217;ve ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949">Beyond Java</a> by <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> to do some swatting up.</p>
