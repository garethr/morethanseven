        OPML Feeds using Radiant
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Jan 2007</span>

    <p>As mentioned when I moved the site over to Radiant I promised a few tutorials and behind the scenes footage of goings on. So here goes with a quick look at how I added a nice <a href="http://morethanseven.net/friends.opml"><span class="caps">OPML</span> feed</a> to my site.</p>
 <p>For those not familiar with <a href="http://www.opml.org/"><span class="caps">OPML</span></a> it&#8217;s an <span class="caps">XML</span> format for outlines, often used for storing blog rolls and the like.</p>
 <p>What I wanted was a friends parent and the ability to add friends to it and for them to appear in a dynamic <span class="caps">OPML</span> feed. The following screenshot shows what I ended up with:</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeed.png" alt="Tree showing Friends feed in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>To accomplish this within Radiant I needed a custom layout, one which would simply render the content but also had the relevant header and footer markup. Note the mime type setting as well.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpmlLayout.png" alt="Layout for OPML in Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Next up is the page which actually uses the <span class="caps">OPML</span> layout to render the page.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFriendsFeedCode.png" alt="friends feed from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>Note that I set the status of all the friends records to hidden, and then set the status of the r:children:each loop to search for hidden children. This way the individual friends records dont show up as seperate pages.</p>
 <p>All I need to do then is add children to the parent, friends-feed in my case. I added a few page parts to each friend page to make management a little easier; a <em>link</em>, a <em>feed</em> and for a little added spice <em>xfn</em>.</p>
 <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEditFriend.png" alt="Edit friend view from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>All in all it makes adding and updating friends easy, and the general approach will work with pretty much any content where you want to compose a single page based on it&#8217;s children.</p>

        Some ponderings on CSS3
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jan 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m starting to get properly interested in CSS3 for a few reasons. I&#8217;ve subscribed to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Mail/Lists.html#www-style">mailing list</a>, read up on some of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">working group goings on</a> and done a bit of research ahead of really jumping in with some code play. Some of this could be of interest to others so here goes:</p>
 <p>The best two resources I&#8217;ve found are the <span class="caps">CSS</span> Working group home page and the <a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3 Info</a></p>
 <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Working Group Under Construction</a> site over at the <a href="http://www.w3.org">W3C</a> has a huge ammount of information. For those that dont know <span class="caps">CSS</span> is being split into a number of distinct modules, namely:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Advanced layout</li>
  <li>Aural Style Sheets</li>
  <li>Backgrounds and Borders</li>
  <li>Basic User Interfaces</li>
  <li>Box Model </li>
  <li>Cascading and Inheritance</li>
  <li>Color</li>
  <li>Fonts</li>
  <li>Generated Content for Paged Media</li>
  <li>Generated and Replaced Content</li>
  <li>Hyperlink Presentation</li>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Line Layout</li>
  <li>Lists</li>
  <li>Maths</li>
  <li>Multi Column Layout</li>
  <li>Namespaces</li>
  <li>Object Model</li>
  <li>Paged Media</li>
  <li>Positioning</li>
  <li>Presentation Levels</li>
  <li>Reader Media Types</li>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Scoping</li>
  <li>Speech</li>
  <li>Syntax</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Text</li>
  <li>Text Layout</li>
  <li>Values and Units</li>
  <li>Web Fonts</li>
</ul>
 <p>Phew. Their is also some work going on on profiles for TV, Printed media and Mobile. I&#8217;m interested in a few of these modules &#8211; particularly those dealing with Web Typography and the Basic User Interface module which deals with <em>the look of form elements in their various states and more cursors and colors to describe GUIs (graphical user interfaces) that blend well with the user&#8217;s desktop environment.</em></p>
 <p><a href="http://css3.info">CSS3 Info</a> also has lots of information worth reading, including some good examples of parts of CSS3 that have been implemented ahead of recommendation in the <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/">preview section</a>. My favourite bit however has to be the <a href="http://www.css3.info/selectors-test/test.html"><span class="caps">CSS</span> selector test</a> by <a href="http://rakaz.nl/">Niels Leenheer</a>. You can read a little more about that, and <a href="http://rakaz.nl/item/how_well_do_browsers_support_css_selectors">how different browsers do</a>, or at least how they did in October. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS3/Selectors/current/html/index.html">W3C test suite</a> is available too, but no where near as slick.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve even gone and installed a <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">WebKit nighly build</a> to try out some of the features only supported their at the moment. Who knows? I might even add new designs to the site using new selectors as a treat for those <em>silly</em> enough to be using such experimental browsers.</p>

    <p>If you&#8217;re viewing this post in your feedreader then you might not notice anything different but it&#8217;s all change around these parts. I&#8217;ve gone all <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> and with it a new slightly minimal design.</p>
 <p>Radiant, for those that missed my earlier gushing post is a Rails based Content Management System that looks something like this:</p>
 <p><img src="/_assets/media/imgRadiantAdmin.png" alt="Morethanseven admin panel from Radiant" /></p>
 <p>I&#8217;m going to post a few follow ups about how I did certain things using Radiant and my particular setup. All in all it&#8217;s been fun. Always a good sign when developing something. I ported all my old posts across from Textpattern and I&#8217;ve posted a project post (in my new <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects-feed">project feed</a>) about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/projects/txp2radiant">TXP2Radiant</a> for anyone else looking to do the same.</p>
 <p>Their will likely be a few gremlins lying around that I&#8217;ll get to over the coming weeks, and I have some decent posts in mind to keep people interested. Expect less about what I&#8217;m up to and more about the pressing issues of web design and development that I keep meaning to write about.</p>
 <p>The design is a little on the minimal side at the moment but on purpose. I want to play around with different designs for the site while keeping everything clean and simple. I might even set a file size limit for the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and I definately want to start playing more with CSS3 selectors (more than 80% of you dont use IE6, for the other 20% <em>please</em> upgrade). I&#8217;m not going to say anything I&#8217;d regret, like one new design every other month, but I can dream.</p>
 <p>As I get more familiar with Rails (one of the reasons for the move) and Radiant I&#8217;ll likely add some bits like a <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> powered gallery and maybe something to do with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> but for the moment it&#8217;s all about the content.</p>

    <p>Their is nothing wrong with a nice header graphic. Clients, designers and customers alike love them. But I often see them used as an excuse for fixed width designs. Well no more I say (unless, of course you have a perfectly good reason for a fixed width design in which case you dont really need this technique.)</p>
<p>The plan was simple. Find a way of incorporating flash headers into sites using liquid or elastic designs in much the same way you might use lots of sliding doors background-image goodness.</p>
<p>And all it takes is a snippet of actionscript goodness:</p>


<pre><code>Stage.scaleMode = "noScale" 
Stage.align = "TL" 
var width
var height
function resizeEvent ( ) {
    width = Stage.width
    height = Stage.height
    dimensions.text    = 
       'width : ' + width+ '
        height : ' + height
    topRight._x = width
    bottomLeft._y = height
    bottomRight._y = height
    bottomRight._x = width
}
resizeEvent ( )
var stageListener = new Object ( );
stageListener.onResize = resizeEvent
Stage.addListener ( stageListener );</code></pre>

    <p><a href="http://webpy.org">Web.py</a> is a really nice lightweight web framework written in Python. It&#8217;s not trying to be Rails or Django, it&#8217;s trying to be as simple as possible. Web.php is my homage to Web.py. I&#8217;ve unashamedly copied the ideas and build a very simple web framework in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It&#8217;s not a complete port, nor does it do everything in the same way.</p>
<p>The code example from the project home page was what originally piqued my interest:</p>

<pre><code>import web
urls = (
   '/(.*)', 'hello'
)
class hello:        
   def GET(self, name):
       i = web.input(times=1)
       if not name: name = 'world'
       for c in xrange(int(i.times)): print 'Hello,', name+'!'
if __name__ == "__main__": web.run(urls, globals())</code></pre>
<p>My <span class="caps">PHP</span> versions goes something like this, I&#8217;m sure you can see the similarities:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;lt;?php
require('webphp/web.php');
$urls = array(
   '/' =&amp;gt; 'hello',
);
class hello {
   function GET($path) {
      echo 'hello world';
   }
}
web::run($urls);
?&amp;gt;</code></pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve used it so far on a couple of projects, but it&#8217;s never been properly tested as such nor do I have lots of time to develop it. It&#8217;s purposely feature and code light (the core file is only 80 odd lines of code, includig comments).</p>
