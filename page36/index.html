        A Simple Python Jabber Bot
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been knocking together various little instant messaging bots recently, partly as a way to play around with <span class="caps">XMPP</span>. As well as using the low level <a href="http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/">xmppy</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpp4r-simple/">XMPP4R-Simple</a> libraries I&#8217;ve been having lots of fun with the <a href="http://thpinfo.com/2007/python-jabberbot/">JabberBot</a> framework.</p>
<p>Jabberbot lets you write simple bots incredibly quickly, using simple conventions to determine what commands the bot exposes. It&#8217;s easier to explain with a simple example. The following bot lets you send the command <em>time</em> to it and returns the current time on the server on which the bot is running. The magic is in the name of the method <em>bot_time_. Any methods that start bot</em> are automatically exposed as commands for the bot to accept.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need an xmpp server for the bot to connect to but you could always just register an additional google account and use it over gtalk if you wanted to. Personally I&#8217;m running <a href="http://www.ejabberd.im">ejabberd</a> on a local Ubuntu VM as well for testing.</p>
<pre>from jabberbot import JabberBot
import datetime
class SystemInfoJabberBot(JabberBot):
    def bot_time( self, mess, args):
        """Displays current server time"""
        return str(datetime.datetime.now())
username = 'my-jabberid@jabberserver.example.org'
password = 'my-password'
bot = SystemInfoJabberBot(username,password)
bot.serve_forever()</pre>
<p>The JabberBot site has a few more examples as well with fancier features. At the recent Last.fm hackday I spent a bit of time knocking together a bot which talks to the Last.fm <span class="caps">API</span> (using the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pylast/">PyLast</a> library for the <span class="caps">API</span> backwards and forwards.) I did this mainly as a demonstration of how simple it can be to create a useful command line interface to your <span class="caps">API</span> using an instant messaging client.</p>
<p>The code for <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master">LastBot</a> is on GitHub. It has a few limitations and doesn&#8217;t intent to cover anywhere near all the <span class="caps">API</span>. When up and running you should be able to talk to it with your IM client. Simply send the user specified in the settings file a message like so:</p>
<pre>search {query}</pre>
<p>So if you wanted to search for “astley” you would type:</p>
<pre>search astley</pre>
<p>Which would probably give you:</p>
<pre>you probably mean Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley
http://www.last.fm/music/Rick_Astley/_/Never_Gonna_Give_You_Up
Richard Paul Astley (born February 6, 1966) is an English dance-pop singer,
songwriter and musician. He was born in Newton-le-Willows, St Helens,
Lancashire, England. Astley currently resides in Richmond, Surrey with his 
Danish girlfriend, Lene Bausager, and their daughter, Emilie. In 1985, Astley 
was playing the club circuit as a singer with a soul band named FBI, when he 
was seen by the record producer Pete Waterman and persuaded to come to London 
to work at the PWL recording studio.</pre>
<p>If the first result that comes back isn’t the one you wanted you can ask for the next result by simply sending next in another message. You can use prev as well to come back through the set.</p>
<pre>next</pre>
<p>You can always send it a call for help at any time which should return the instructions to you via an IM message.</p>
<pre>help</pre>
<p>Which should return something like:</p>
<pre>Personal LastFM search bot. Useful for looking for tracks you can't 
remember the full name of. Or for findind out who sung a track.
search: do a search for tracks
prev: get details about the previous track in the list
next: get details about the next track in the list</pre>
<p>More instructions, and the code behind the bot, can be found in the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master"><span class="caps">README</span></a>.</p>
<p>As developers we spend a lot of time using command line interfaces &#8211; mainly for speed and because you can cram a lot of functionality into a small amount of screen real estate. We&#8217;re increasingly spending time debugging <span class="caps">API</span> calls as well and exposing your <span class="caps">API</span> calls for use by instant messaging clients has the potential to make development easier. Think of the Python interactive shell or of <span class="caps">IRB</span>, but for APIs.</p>

        Are XMPP and offline processing coming to Google App Engine?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>Google <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2009/01/changes-for-jaiku-and-farewell-to.html">just announced</a> that, once the port of <a href="http://www.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> to App Engine is complete they will be Open Sourcing the code and stopping official development. I only used Jaiku sporadically in the heady days when everyone had to sign up for a new web 2.0 service every week or be mocked by their colleagues. What really interests me about this move though is what it means for App Engine.</p>
<p>If memory serves <a href="http://www.jaiku.com/blog/2007/08/30/jaiku-from-your-instant-messenger/">Jaiku had an instant message interface</a>. Does that mean App Engine is going to get an <span class="caps">XMPP</span> interface?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also presuming the original Jaiku application had at least some features powered by offline processing or used a message based architecture behind the scenes? Or used scheduled batch jobs for reporting or data mungling?</p>
<p>All of these issues are high up on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">App Engine issues list</a> and solutions to these two outstanding problems would move App Engine, in my opinion, to being very cool to being very useful. I&#8217;ve been impressed with the simple, well designed and well documented current set of APIs and I&#8217;d love to see a few more added for <span class="caps">XMPP</span> and offline processing. If the Jaiku code is open source but relies on Google only APIs it would seem a little odd.</p>
<p>So does anyone have any more information on this? Any passing Googlers who can get us an answer?</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>One of several little projects I have up and running on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> at present is <a href="http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master">LocalBuilder</a>. It&#8217;s a pretty simple little script which watches for changes in a given directory and when they occur runs a given command. I knocked it together to use to trigger the running of a test suite each time I save files in a project. It&#8217;s written in Python but you could use it to run commands in any language you like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all pretty simple Python really and is hopefully reasonably commented and tested so if you&#8217;re interested you can follow along with <a href="http://github.com/garethr/localbuilder/tree/master">the code</a>. If you just want to use the damn thing then:</p>
<pre><code>./localbuilder --path /path/to/watch --command /command/to/execute</code></pre>
<p>It turns out Ruby has a much nicer tool to do this and more in autotest, part of the <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/ZSS/Products/ZenTest/">ZenTest</a> suite of testing tools. I&#8217;m finding more and more very nice bits of code written in Ruby of late, but that&#8217;s probably a whole different blog post.</p>

        Speaking at Bamboo Juice

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>It&#8217;s the start of another year so that means it&#8217;s time to start thinking about conferences.</p>
<p>I just found out at the end of last week (<a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales/status/1106721057">via Twitter no less</a>) that I&#8217;ve been confirmed as one of the speakers for <a href="http://bamboojuice.co.uk">Bamboo Juice</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/binarytales">Jon</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/richquick">Rich</a> for having me. I&#8217;m really looking forward to that as it&#8217;s a new event outside London (at the rather fabulous looking Eden project in Cornwall), which should hopefully mean a chance for a new set of people to go along to what looks like a decent event. I&#8217;ll have more information about what I&#8217;m going to be talking about some time between then and now I would imagine, but the emphasis is on practical learnings for working developers and designers.</p>
<p>Apart from that the only other conference I&#8217;ve confirmed I&#8217;l be attending so far is <a href="http://www.thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> in May. It was great last year even if I spent the majority of the time running round organising barcamp, moving house or leaving Newcastle. This time I&#8217;m not involved in any organising (<a href="http://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1095746624">sorry Andy</a>)  so I plan on making the most of the talks and general experience. Rumour has it that their will be another barcamp as well so I&#8217;ll look forward to that too. It will be good to get back up to Newcastle and see people again.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also looking forward to <a href="http://twitter.com/ptg/status/1096802734">what Patrick is up to for @media</a>. It was the conference that started this whole thing rolling in the UK back in the day and now it appears it might be set for a change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Time to finalise the line-up and web site for a very different (and lower price!) @media &#8217;09</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as these three I&#8217;ll be keeping my eye out for any news about Xtech, The Highland Fling and any other new upcoming conferences. If you know of anything else leave a comment. I didn&#8217;t find out about <a href="http://www.thinkvisibility.com/">Think Visibility</a> until it had sold out but I like the idea of smaller, specialised events.</p>
<p>Overall it already looks like being a good year for conference goers in the UK. I&#8217;ll be on the lookout for barcamp style events as well but I do like a good formal conference as well. Hopefully see a few people at some of these events?</p>

        APIs in 2009 - XMPP and WebHooks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2009</span>

    <p>Everyone has to have a post with a year in the title at the start of the year so I thought I better write something. Rather than one of those personal retrospective emails I thought I&#8217;d go for something different &#8211; a look at what I&#8217;d like to see in APIs in the coming year.</p>
<h2>Webhooks</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty interested in the idea of applications exposing <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com/">Webhooks</a> at the moment. It&#8217;s a pretty simple idea. As a user of a service you can register your own <span class="caps">HTTP</span> end points to receive information whenever events occur in the service.  Both <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/WebHook">Shopify</a> and <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GiHub</a> have pretty nifty hooks for extending their capabilities for instance. When someone pushes code to a git repository you could send a ping to trigger a process to update the documentation for example.</p>
<p>With the rise of hosted application development environments like <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">AppEngine</a> writing small, nearly throwaway, apps to subscribe to these hooks could become incredibly powerful. It&#8217;s a lot like how unix programmers think, by piping lots of small applications together to get to the expected end result. It&#8217;s not a replacement for the more standard read/write <span class="caps">API</span>, but it&#8217;s a potential solution to the need to constantly poll that <span class="caps">API</span> for some types of applications.</p>
<p>The idea of public webhooks would be hugely powerful, but would also likely be a scalability nightmare. Imagine if Flickr exposed a hook that you could subscribe to whenever anyone added a public photo. Or Twitter added a hook for when anyone tweeted. These sorts of hooks would quickly be swamped with subscribers. The number of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests being sent by a service like Flickr under these circumstances would be <em>rather large</em> to say the least. Which is where another technology that&#8217;s designed for this sort of problem becomes useful.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">XMPP</span> Interfaces</h2>
<p><a href="http://xmpp.org/"><span class="caps">XMPP</span></a> or the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol has been around for a while, although originally under the name Jabber. It&#8217;s predominantly being used at the moment as a instant messaging protocol, but in reality it&#8217;s far more general purpose than that. Or rather, IM is generally considered to be between two or more people. But their is no reason that either or all the participants in an <span class="caps">XMPP</span> session can&#8217;t be programs.</p>
<p>On my local machine I&#8217;m a big fan of the command line for all sorts of simple, and sometimes complex, tasks.  If applications expose their APIs via an <span class="caps">XMPP</span> bot then you basically have a ready made command line interface to online services via your IM client of choice. Combined with a solution to the public webhook problem mentioned above and you can hopefully see why I find <span class="caps">XMPP</span> pretty interesting.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing with writing <span class="caps">XMPP</span> bots recently, both at our internal hackday and at the recent <a href="http://github.com/garethr/lastbot/tree/master">Last.fm event</a>. Their are various libraries and code examples lying around the internet that make getting started easy enough. With services like <a href="http://imified.com/">Imified</a> getting setup last year I&#8217;d imagine it will get easier still this year.</p>
<p>As for what I&#8217;m going to be up to along these lines, we&#8217;ll have to wait and see. I have a few pet projects that I&#8217;d like to get off the ground which might be good test beds for this sort of thing. Apart from that I&#8217;d like to write some <em>getting started</em> style tutorials on some of the technologies involved or maybe a full blown article on the theory if I can find somewhere to publish it. A barcamp presentation or two might also fall off the back if I do get the time to play around a little more. But that&#8217;s just me. If you&#8217;re building, or planning on developing, an <span class="caps">API</span> for a product at the moment I&#8217;d suggest having a look at these two areas. They might turn out to just be potential extensions to what you had planned. Or they might turn out to be just the right approach to the problems you&#8217;ll face getting people to use your <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
