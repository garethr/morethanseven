    <p><a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart</a> at work has been playing with a nice <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/spyder">Python web crawler</a> recently. I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.harvestmanontheweb.com/">Harvestman</a> before but it&#8217;s not the most straightforward thing to work with. Spyder has a really nifty callback based approach and a couple of hooks which allows you to write code like:</p>
<pre>crawler = Spyder()
crawler.register(my_custom_method, 'post_fetch_html')
crawler.run(URL)</pre>
<p>On a side note I wish <a href="http://launchpad.net">Launchpad</a> was as clean and tidy as <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> though. I can see GitHub adding some of the features that Launchpad has eventually, but I hope they fit them in around the existing features.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s probably old hat to those who have been using Google Appengine for a while but I just found <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-app-engine-samples/">some sample apps</a> on Google Code. I prefer learning from actual code like this, at least until the App Engine books make it out next year.</p>

    <p>I upload the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/css-test/tree/master">work I&#8217;ve done so far</a> on testing <span class="caps">CSS</span>. It&#8217;s still work in progress obviously but if you&#8217;re interested do let me know. I&#8217;ve stared with the image approach but will hopefully have something up demonstrating the selenium/rendered <span class="caps">DOM</span> position approach as well.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d been meaning to write a quick article about <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but then <a href="http://mikewest.org/2008/11/i-love-github">Mike</a> and <a href="http://thecodetrain.co.uk/2008/11/make-it-work-make-it-pretty-make-it-right/">Neil</a> beat me to it and stole most of the best bits. Read both of those articles then come back if you want. I agree whole heartedly.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve used public hosted source control before. But Google Code, Sourceforge or Launchpad never felt like this. Their were always their for people to download your code if they wanted. Maybe you collaborated with a few people on a specific project. But GitHub, through a combination of neat visualisations and social features, is encouraging people to just upload <em>all</em> their code. All those lines of throw away scripts. All that code written on the train learning a new language. All that configuration stuff that normally gets missed.</p>
<p>Talk of emerging programming languages often shifts to the need for a killer application. I want to learn more about Git so I can do more with GitHub. For me, that makes GitHub a likely driving force behind a sea of Git adoption in the coming year or so. I&#8217;m also interested to see what comes out of a reasonable sized network of like-minded people absentmindedly hacking away. Already I&#8217;m seeing people branch other peoples code within my network of contacts. Often just small tweaks and changes &#8211; like a code fairy cleaning up a few rough edges or adding an extra line here.</p>
<p>So, if you write code head over to GitHub and signup. Create a few repositories of the things you&#8217;re hacking on at the moment and jump through the pre-portable-social-network dance just one more time. I promise it&#8217;s worth it this time.</p>

    <p><a href="http://cssdoc.net/"><span class="caps">CSSDOC</span></a> looks like a good idea. I&#8217;m sure a few people mentioned this last year at @media after the talk by the people from The Guardian but nothing came from it. Hopefully tools will start to come about soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">CSSDOC</span> is a convention to comment Cascading Style Sheets (<span class="caps">CSS</span>) to help individuals and teams to improve writing/coding/styling/managing <span class="caps">CSS</span> files. It is an adoption of the well known JavaDoc / DocBlock based way of commenting source-code. That&#8217;s putting style, docblocks and tags together.</p>
