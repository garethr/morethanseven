    <p>I&#8217;d been meaning to write a quick article about <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, but then <a href="http://mikewest.org/2008/11/i-love-github">Mike</a> and <a href="http://thecodetrain.co.uk/2008/11/make-it-work-make-it-pretty-make-it-right/">Neil</a> beat me to it and stole most of the best bits. Read both of those articles then come back if you want. I agree whole heartedly.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve used public hosted source control before. But Google Code, Sourceforge or Launchpad never felt like this. Their were always their for people to download your code if they wanted. Maybe you collaborated with a few people on a specific project. But GitHub, through a combination of neat visualisations and social features, is encouraging people to just upload <em>all</em> their code. All those lines of throw away scripts. All that code written on the train learning a new language. All that configuration stuff that normally gets missed.</p>
<p>Talk of emerging programming languages often shifts to the need for a killer application. I want to learn more about Git so I can do more with GitHub. For me, that makes GitHub a likely driving force behind a sea of Git adoption in the coming year or so. I&#8217;m also interested to see what comes out of a reasonable sized network of like-minded people absentmindedly hacking away. Already I&#8217;m seeing people branch other peoples code within my network of contacts. Often just small tweaks and changes &#8211; like a code fairy cleaning up a few rough edges or adding an extra line here.</p>
<p>So, if you write code head over to GitHub and signup. Create a few repositories of the things you&#8217;re hacking on at the moment and jump through the pre-portable-social-network dance just one more time. I promise it&#8217;s worth it this time.</p>

    <p><a href="http://cssdoc.net/"><span class="caps">CSSDOC</span></a> looks like a good idea. I&#8217;m sure a few people mentioned this last year at @media after the talk by the people from The Guardian but nothing came from it. Hopefully tools will start to come about soon.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been doing some performance profiling of this here blog. Not because I really need to due to huge amounts of traffic unfortunately, more because I&#8217;m planning on releasing the code and wanted to give it a good once over before I do.</p>

<p>The above profile is from the home page which seemed a good starting point. The majority of the other pages are more straightforward, generally displaying just one article with a few related bits and pieces.</p>
<p>What jumped out was that the majority of the slow traces (the list is ordered with the slowest calls first) were to do with the use of the textile filter packaged with Django. Textile is a simple markup language which converts to <span class="caps">HTML</span>, I&#8217;ve used it for all my writing activities since I used Textpattern on this blog many moons ago. It&#8217;s not just the traces that explicitly mentioned textile either &#8211; the regular expression calls are also to do with template filters.</p>
<p>I quickly added a hidden html field to my model and a custom save method. On saving an article I now automatically transform the textile version of the content and save it in the html field. In the template where I used to have <code>article.content|textile</code> I now have <code>article.html</code>. A quick check of the profile on the same page showed a dramatic increase in performance:</p>

<p>From nearly half a second (0.479 <span class="caps">CPU</span> seconds) to 0.081 <span class="caps">CPU</span> seconds &#8211; roughly a 500% improvement in performance!</p>
<p>If you are using text transforming filters in Django that make use of regular expressions I would look to try and get rid of them and move the conversion into a save method. You might not see quite as much of a performance gain as I did here but I&#8217;d be surprised if it&#8217;s not taking an awful lot longer than you might thing.</p>
<p>Their are a few tools that are handy to have around if you&#8217;re wanting to profile your own applications. Django Snippets has a handy <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/70/">profiling middleware</a> and the really rather nice <a href="http://code.google.com/p/django-command-extensions/">Command Extensions</a> provides a few more tools including profile graph generation.</p>

        Simulating Rails like Environments in Django
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2008</span>

    <p>I was always a fan of <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/Environments">Rail environments</a> and as part of some work upgrading this site to the latest version of Django I decided to clean up my whole deployment process. Part of that involved replacing everything in settings.py with the following snippet of code:</p>
<pre>ENV = "development"
try:
    exec "from environments." + ENV + " import *"
except ImportError:
    print "You must specify a valid environment"
    exit()</pre>
<p>I now have two settings files stored in an environments module containing all the usual django settings; one for my development environment and one suitable for live. The settings.py above is for my local development environment, with only one small change for live (this file doesn&#8217;t get deployed along with the source code for the site, so doesn&#8217;t get overwritten).</p>
<pre>ENV = 'live'</pre>
<p>This isn&#8217;t quite the same as the Rails implementation obviously. I run completely different server setups so I&#8217;m not too bothered about a flag on the runserver command like the -e flag for mongel. I could also probably do something to autodetect the environment but this works fine for me.</p>
