        Unikernels and The End of the General Purpose Operating System
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2016</span>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2016/11/05/the-end-of-the-general-purpose-operating-system-as-it-happens/">previous
post</a>
went into why I think the days of the general purpose operating system
(for servers) are numbered. But one interesting area I didn&#39;t comment
on (but did talk about in the talk of the same name) was Unikernels.</p>

<h2>It&#39;s all about cost</h2>

<p>One of the topics I didn&#39;t really touch on in discussing the end of the
generally purpose operating system was cost. Historically,
maintaining a general purpose operating system has been a costly
endeavour, something only the largest companies or communities could
sustain by themselves. Think Red Hat, Oracle, Microsoft, Sun, IBM,
Debian, etc. The result of that is the assumption when building software
that you should target one or more of a small number of operating systems.
In doing so you&#39;re ceding some ground, and likely some revenue, to another
vendor. You&#39;re also stuck with any underlying limitations of that OS as
well as its release cadence. And invariably you&#39;re also stuck with the
multiplying support cost of supporting your software on multiple versions of
that OS over time.</p>

<p>I would posit that up until relatively recently the cost of that support
burden was hugely outweighted by the cost of maintaining an actual operating
system. But that&#39;s now changing, as I outlined in the previous post. Now a
small or medium sized software company (be it CoreOS, Rancher, Docker,
Pivotal, etc.) can build and maintain it&#39;s own operating system as well.
This is very much about the rising level of abstraction - all of the
above leverage the huge efforts that go into the Linux kernel and into
other projects like systemd (CoreOS) or Alpine (Docker&#39;s Moby) for
instance.</p>

<h2>Enter Unikernells</h2>

<p>But where do Unikernels fit into this narrative? I&#39;d argue that they
represent the fulfilment of this democratization. If building and
maintaining a traditional OS is only possible for the largest of
companies, and building and maintaining a more special-purpose OS (say
for running containers, or a storage device) is cost-effective for medium
sized softare companies, then Unikernels will allow anyone to build their
own single-purpose operating systems.</p>

<p>There are other technical reasons for (and against) Unikernels as an
approach but most focus on the technical. I think the economic side is
worth some consideration too. And not just the typical development and
support costs, but the ability to own the end-to-end unit of software
has lots of benefits, and Unikernels may make those benefits available
to everyone, including small organisations and individuals.</p>

        The End of the General Purpose Operating System
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Nov 2016</span>

    <p>As interesting chat on Twitter today reminded me that not everyone is
probably aware that we&#39;re seeing a concerted attempt to dislodge the
general purpose operating system from our servers.</p>

<p>I gave a talk about some of this <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/the-end-of-the-general-purpose-operating-system">nearly two years
ago</a>
and I though a blog post looking at what I got right, what I got wrong
and what&#39;s actually happening would be of interest to folks. The talk
was written only a few months after I joined Puppet. With a bunch
more time working for a software vendor there are some bits I missed in
my original discussion.</p>

<h2>What do you mean by general purpose and by end?</h2>

<p>First up, a bit of clarification. By <em>general purpose OS</em> I&#39;m referring
to what most people use for server workloads today - be it RHEL or variants
like CentOS or Fedora, or Debian and derivatives like Ubuntu. We&#39;ll
include Arch, the various BSD and opensolaris flavours and Windows too.
By <em>end</em> I don&#39;t literally mean they go away or stop being useful. My
hypothosis is that, slowly to begin with then more quickly, they cease
to be the default we reach for when launching new services.</p>

<h2>The hypervisor of containers</h2>

<p>The first part of the talk included a discussion of what I&#39;d referred to
as <em>the hypervisor of containers</em>, what today would more likely be
referred to as a CaaS, or containers as a service. I even speculated
that VMWare would have to ship something in this space (See vSphere Integrated
Containers and the work on Photon OS) and that counting out OpenShift
would be premature (OpenShift 3 shipped predominantly as a Kubernetes
distribution). I&#39;ll come back to why this is a threat to your beloved
Debian servers shortly.</p>

<h2>The race to PID1</h2>

<p>For anyone who has run Docker you&#39;ll likely have wrestled with the
question of where does the role of the host process supervisor (probably systemd)
start and the container process supervisor (the Docker engine) end? Do
you have to interact directly with both of them?</p>

<p>Now imagine if <em>all</em> of the software on your servers was run in containers.
Why do I need two process supervisors now with 100% overlap? The obvious
answer is you don&#39;t, which is why the fight between Docker and systemd
is inevitable. Note that this isn&#39;t specific to Docker either. In-scope
for <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/cri-o">cri-o</a> is <em>Container
process lifecycle management</em>.</p>

<h2>Containers as the unit of software</h2>

<p>Hidden behind my hypothosis, which mainly went unsaid, was
that containers are becoming the unit of software. By which I mean
the software we build or buy will increasingly be distributed as
containers and run as containers. The container will carry with it
enough metadata for the runtime to determine what resources are
required to run it.</p>

<p>The number of simplying assumption that come from this shared contract should not
be underestimated. At least at the host level you&#39;re likely to need lots
of near-identical hosts, all simply advertising their capabilities to
the container scheduler.</p>

<h2>Operating system as implementation detail</h2>

<p>What we&#39;re witnessing in the market is the development of vertically integrated
stacks.</p>

<ul>
<li>Docker for Mac/Windows/AWS/Azure ships with it&#39;s own operating
system, an Alpine Linux derivative <a href="http://lucjuggery.com/blog/?p=753">nicknamed Moby</a>, which is not intended for direct management by end users.</li>
<li>Tectonic from CoreOS is a Kubernetes distribution which runs atop a
cluster of managed CoreOS hosts. Most of the operating system is
managed with frequent atomic rolling updates.</li>
<li>OpenShift Enterprise from RedHat is another Kubernetes derivative,
this time running atop Atomic host.</li>
<li>Pivotal CloudFoundry <a href="https://twitter.com/jambay/status/794904634502496257">ships with the IaaS, host OS, kernel, file
system, container OS all tested
together</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In all of these cases the operating system is an implementation detail
of the higher level software. It&#39;s not intended to be directly managed,
or at least managed to the same degree as the general purpose OS you&#39;re
running today.</p>

<p>This is how the end comes for the majority of your general purpose
operating system running servers. The machines running containers will
be running something more single purpose, and more and more of the
software you&#39;re running will be running in containers.</p>

<p>The reason why you&#39;ll do this, rather than compose everything yourself, is
compatability. Whether it&#39;s kernel versions, file system drivers,
operating system variants or a hundred variations that make your OS
build different from mine. Building and testing software that runs
everywhere is a sisyphean task. Their is also the commercial angle at
play here, and the advantage of being able to support a single validated
product to everyone.</p>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>There are lots of implications to this move, and it&#39;s going to be
interesting to see how it plays out with both early adopters and
enterprise customers alike.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does this mean for corporate operating system policies?</li>
<li>How do standard agent-based monitoring systems work in a world of
closed vertical stacks?</li>
<li>Will we see this pattern for other types of service in the AWS Marketplace,
where instance launched are inaccessible but automatically updating?</li>
<li>How does such fast moving software work in environments with rigid
change control processes or audit requirements?</li>
<li>Many large organisations will end up running more than one of these
types of system, how best to manage such heterogenous environments?</li>
<li>Will we see push back from some parties? In particular the open source
community who may see this mainly serving the needs of vendors?</li>
<li>Does the end of the general purpose OS lead to greater specialism
amongst systems administrators?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d love to chat about any of this with other folks who have given it
some thought. It&#39;s interesting watching grand changes play out across
the industry and picking up on patterns that are likely obvious in
hindsight. And if you like this sort of thing let me know and I&#39;ll try
and find time for more speculation.</p>

      <a href="/2016/10/07/infrakit-hello-world/">
        InfraKit Hello World
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2016</span>

    <p>Docker just shipped <a href="https://github.com/docker/infrakit">InfraKit</a> a few days ago at LinuxCon and, while at the Docker Distributed Systems Summit, I wanted to see if I could get a hello world example up and running. The documentation is lacking at the moment, epecially around how to tie the different components like instances and flavors together.</p>

<p>The following example isn&#39;t going to do anything particularly useful, but it&#39;s hopefully simple enough to help anyone else trying to get started. I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve checked out and built the binaries as described in the <a href="https://github.com/docker/infrakit#building">README</a>.</p>

<p>First create a directory. We&#39;re going to be using InfraKit to manage local files in that directory as part of the demo.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">mkdir test
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now create an InfraKit configuration file. We&#39;re going to use the <code>file</code> instance plugin to manage files in out directory. This means everything works on the local machine, rather than trying to launch real infrastructure in AWS or similar. InfraKit also requires a <code>flavor</code> plugin. I&#39;m using <code>vanilla</code> here just to meet the requirement for a flavor plugin, but it&#39;s not going to actually do anything in this demo. It might be useful to write a noop flavor plugin or similar.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cat garethr.json
</code></pre></div><div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-json" data-lang="json"><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;ID&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;garethr&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;Properties&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;Instance&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;Plugin&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;instance-file&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;Properties&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="p">},</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;Flavor&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;Plugin&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;flavor-vanilla&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="nt">&quot;Properties&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
                <span class="nt">&quot;Size&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>InfraKit is based on running separate plugins. Each plugin runs as a separate process and provides a filesystem socket in /run/infrakit/plugins. First start up the file plugin:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./infrakit/file --dir=./test
INFO[0000] Starting plugin
INFO[0000] Listening on: unix:///run/infrakit/plugins/instance-file.sock
INFO[0000] listener protocol= unix addr= /run/infrakit/plugins/instance-file.sock err= &lt;nil&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, in a separate terminal run the vanilla plugin:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./infrakit/vanilla
INFO[0000] Starting plugin
INFO[0000] Listening on: unix:///run/infrakit/plugins/flavor-vanilla.sock
INFO[0000] listener protocol= unix addr= /run/infrakit/plugins/flavor-vanilla.sock err= &lt;nil&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>An finally run the group plugin. I&#39;m passing <code>--log=5</code> to enable more verbose outout so it&#39;s easier to see what&#39;s going on with the group.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./infrakit/group --log=5
INFO[0000] Starting discovery
DEBU[0000] Opening: /run/infrakit/plugins
DEBU[0000] Discovered plugin at unix:///run/infrakit/plugins/instance-file.sock
INFO[0000] Starting plugin
INFO[0000] Starting
INFO[0000] Listening on: unix:///run/infrakit/plugins/group.sock
INFO[0000] listener protocol= unix addr= /run/infrakit/plugins/group.sock err= &lt;nil&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p>With that all setup we can create a group based on our configuration file from above.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./infrakit/cli group --name group watch garethr.json
watching garethr
</code></pre></div>
<p>Have a look in the test directory. You should see a single file has been created.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ls test
instance-1475833380
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&#39;s delete that file and see what happens:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">rm test/*
</code></pre></div>
<p>Hopefully InfraKit will spot the instance (a file in this case) no longer exists and recreate it. You should see something like the following in the logs:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">INFO[0612] Created instance instance-1475833820 with tags map[infrakit.config_sha:B2MsacXz8V_ztsjAzu3tu3zivlw= infrakit.group:garethr]
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is obviously a less-than-useful example but hopefully provides a good hello world example for anyone trying to run InfraKit in it&#39;s current early stage.</p>

      <a href="/2016/07/05/everyone-is-not-a-software-company/">
        Everyone is Not a Software Company
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jul 2016</span>

    <p>The <em>Everyone is a Software Company</em> meme has been around for a
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2011/11/30/now-every-company-is-a-software-company/#22c372311009">number</a>
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/now-that-everyone-is-a-software-company-should-they-operate-like-software-companies/">of</a>
<a href="http://blogs.gartner.com/peter-sondergaard/everyone-is-a-technology-company/">years</a>,
but it feels increasingly hard to get away from recently. That prompted
this post.</p>

<h2>But what do we mean by Software Company?</h2>

<p>To be software company you&#39;re going to need to employee software
engineers and other professionals. Applying that logic to a large
number of companies at once, and looking at how existing
<em>software companies</em> are setup, we find a few large problems.</p>

<h2>Google as an example</h2>

<p>In my talk at Velocity, entitled <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/the-two-sides-to-google-infrastructure-for-everyone-else">The Two Sides of Google Infrastructure
for Everyone
Else</a>
I argued both for and against the idea of wholesale adoption of
Google-like software and development/operations practices.
Even though they derive the lions share of revenue from advertising it&#39;s
easy to argue that Google are a software company. But what does that look like?
What makes Google a software company?</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/20151231_alphabet_10K.pdf">Google Annual Report
2015</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>61,814 full-time employees: 23,336 in research and development,
19,082 in sales and marketing, 10,944 in operations, and 8,452
in general and administrative functions</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, roughly 50% of Google is involved in building or running software.
<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Salaries-E9079.htm">Glassdoor</a>
says salaries for engineers at Google average about $126,000-$162,000.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm">US Bureau of Labor Statistics says</a>
that in 2014 the number of computer programming jobs in the US
was 1,114,000, with median pay in 2015 of $100,690 a year. The
total number of jobs in the US is about 143 million, with the
average wages at $44,569.20 according to the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/awidevelop.html">Social Security
Administration</a>.</p>

<p>The Google Annual Report also states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense,
particularly for software engineers, computer
scientists, and other technical staff</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, quick summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software engineers are expensive relative to others employees</li>
<li>Demand for the best engineers means even higher wages</li>
<li>Proportionally there aren&#39;t many software developers</li>
<li>There isn&#39;t a large surplus of unemployed software engineers</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the data above is mainly from US sources, although the Google data
is from an international company with offices around the world. My
experience says this is likely similar in Europe. Looking into data for
India and China would be super interesting I&#39;d wager.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>One obvious problem is short-term supply and demand. Everyone wants
experienced software folks for their transformation effort. But the more
organisations that buy into the <em>everyone is a software company</em> story
the greater the demand for a finite supply of people. For most
that means you&#39;ll to able to find less people that you want because of
competition and afford even less people because all that competition
pushes up salaries.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen that firsthand while working for the UK Government. People
occasionally complained that Government was hampering commercial
organisations growth by employing lots of developers and operations
people in London.</p>

<p>You&#39;re also immediately in competition for software professionals with
existing software companies. Given the high salaries, most of
those employers already have developer friendly working environments and
established hiring practices suited to luring developers to work for
them. This sort of special case is hard for large companies without an
existing empowered developer organisation. I saw a lot of that at the
Government as well.</p>

<p>But the real macro problems are much more interesting. Even if you think
50% is a high mark for the ratio of software folk to others, you probably
agree you need a lot more than you have today. And those developers just
don&#39;t exist today to allow <em>everyone to be a software company</em>. Nor
would I argue is education in the near term producing enough skilled
people to fill that gap tomorrow. So, what happens?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does everyone sort-of become a software company but not quite?</li>
<li>Do most organisations struggle to hire and maintain a software team
and see the endeavour fail?</li>
<li>Do increasing numbers of developers end up working for a small number
of larger and larger software companies?</li>
<li>Does outsourcing bounceback,  adapt and demonstrate innovation and
transformation qualities to go along with the scale?</li>
<li>Countries like India or China are able to produce enough software engineers
at scale to allow there companies to act on everyone becoming a
software company?</li>
<li>We see clear winners and losers, ie. companies which become software
companies and accelarate away from those that don&#39;t?</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I think to take advantage of the idea behind the meme we&#39;re
going to need order of magnitude more efficient approaches to software
delivery. What that looks like is the most interesting question of all.</p>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>The above is not a detailed analysis, and undoutedly has a few holes. It
also doesn&#39;t overly question the <em>advantage</em> of being a software
company, or really question what we actually mean by <em>everyone</em>. But I
think the central point holds: Everyone is NOT a software company, nor
will everyone be a software company any time soon, unless we come up
with a fundamentally better approach to service delivery.</p>

      <a href="/2015/12/27/operations-more-than-systems-administration/">
        Operations is more than just Systems Administration
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Dec 2015</span>

    <p>I think one of the patterns of the last few years has been the
democratization of systems administration, especially for web
applications. Whether that&#39;s Heroku or Docker, or Chef or Puppet, more
and more traditional developers are doing work that would have been
<em>somebody else&#39;s problem</em> only a few years ago. But running in parallel
to that thread is another less positive trend, that of conflating
operations with <em>just</em> systems administation. The story seems to go that
now we know Ansible (or some other tool) we just need developers to run
the show.</p>

<p>In this post I&#39;m going to try and introduce some of the other
operational disciplines, especially for developers who maybe have come
to operations via the above resurgence in infrastructure tooling over
the past few years.</p>

<p>Note that this post has a slight bias towards more <em>normal</em>
organisations. That is to say if you&#39;re in a 5 person software startup
you probably don&#39;t have operational problems to worry too much about
yet. I&#39;m also not playing down the practice of systems administration,
most experienced sysadmins I know are also quite rounded operations pros
as well.</p>

<h2>Service Management</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve worked in operations, or in many large organisations you&#39;ll have
come across the term Service Management. This tends to be linked to
various service management frameworks; like ITIL or MOF (Microsoft
Operations Framework). The framework will describe, often in great
detail, activities and processes for things like incident response,
configuration management, change management, capacity planning and more.</p>

<p>While I was at <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">The Government</a> I wrote what I
think is a reasonable introduction to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/operations/service-management.html">Service 
Management</a>
albeit from a specific point-of-view. This was based on my experience of
trying, and likely sometimes failing, to encourage teams to think about
how the products they we&#39;re working on would be run. Each of the topics
touched on in the overview is worthy of it&#39;s own stack of books, but I
will repeat the ITIL service list here as (whatever you might think of
the framework or a specific implementation) I&#39;d found it a useful starting
point for conversations - in particular stressing the breadth of
topics under service management.</p>

<h4>Service Strategy</h4>

<ul>
<li>IT service management</li>

<p>For each of the above points, whether you are using ITIL or not, it&#39;s
useful to have a conversation. Some of these areas do provide ample
opportunity for automation and for using tooling to minimise the effort
required. But much of this is about designing <em>how</em> you are going to
operate a service throughout it&#39;s lifetime.</p>

<h2>Operations user stories</h2>

<p>One of the other things I published while at The Government was a set of
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/operations/web-operations-stories.html">user stories for a web operations 
team</a>.
These grew out of work on launching GOV.UK and have had input from
various past colleagues. In hindsight I&#39;d probably do somethings
here differently, the stories assume a certain context which isn&#39;t explicitly
spelled out for instance. But they have a couple of things going for them in that
they demonstrate how traditional operations activities can be planned out as part
of a more developer-friendly planning approach, and also they are public and
have been tested by more than a single team.</p>

<h2>Not everything is a programming problem</h2>

<p>The main point I think is that not everything can be turned into a
programming problem to solve. Automation has it&#39;s place, and many manual
processes and practices can benefit from automation. But the wide range
of activities involved in running a non-trivial and often non-ideal
system in production tend to mean making trade-offs and prioritization
decisions frequently. This is where softer skills like arguing for
funding or additional head count, or building a business case for
further work, come into play. Operations management is much more than
systems administration.</p>

<h2>Further reading</h2>

<p>This is little more than a plea for people to think more about
operations, separate to the more technical aspects of systems
administration. If you&#39;re interested in learning more however I would
recommend some good reading material:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.itpi.org/the-visible-ops-handbook-review.html">Visible Ops
Handbook</a> -
still an excellent and pragmatic introduction to many of the topics
noted above.</li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033080.do">Designig Delivery</a> -
a bang up-to-date tome covering a range of service design topics.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.basicsm.com/bsm-basic-service-management-book">Basic Service
Management</a> -
a 50 page starter book covering the fundamentals of service
management as generally discussed in more detail elsewhere. A great
starting point.</li>
