        Leaving GDS never easy
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Jul 2014</span>

    <p><em>The following is the email I sent to lots of my colleagues at the 
<a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> last week.</em></p>

<p>So, after 3 rather exciting years I&#39;ve decided to leave GDS.</p>

<p>That&#39;s surprisingly difficult to write if I&#39;m honest.</p>

<p>I was part of the team that built and shipped the beta of <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.
Since then I&#39;ve worked across half of what has become GDS, equally
helping and frustrating (then hopefully helping) lots of you. I&#39;ve
done a great deal and learnt even more, as well as collected arcane
knowledge about government infosec and the dark arts of procurement
along the way. I&#39;ve done, and helped others do, work I wouldn&#39;t even
have thought possible (or maybe likely is the right word?) when I
started.</p>

<p>So why leave? For all the other things I do I&#39;m basically a tool
builder. So I&#39;m going off to work for <a href="http://puppetlabs.com">Puppet Labs</a> to build
infrastructure tools that don&#39;t suck. That sort of pretty specific
work is something that <em>should</em> be done outside government in my
opinion. I&#39;m a pretty firm believer in &quot;government should only do what
only government can do&quot; (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles#second">design principle number 2</a> for those that
haven&#39;t memorised them yet). And if I&#39;m honest, focusing on something
smaller than fixing a country&#39;s civic infrastructure is appealing for
now.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll let you in on a secret; I didn&#39;t join what became GDS because of
the GOV.UK project. I joined to work with friends I&#39;d not yet had the
chance to work with and to see the inside of a growing organisation
from the start. I remember <a href="http://twitter.com/tomskitomski">Tom Loosemore</a> promising me we&#39;d be 200
people in 3 years! As far as anyone knows we&#39;re 650+ people. That&#39;s
about a person a day for 2 years. I&#39;m absolutely not saying that came
without a cost, but for me being part of that that was part of the
point - so I can be a little accepting with hindsight.</p>

<p>For me, apart from all the short term things (side-note: this job now
has me thinking £10million is a small amount of money and 2 years is a
small amount of time) there is one big mission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Make government a sustainable part of the UK tech community</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That means in 10 years time experienced tech people from across the
country, as well as people straight from university, choosing to work
for government. Not just for some abstract and personal reason (though
that&#39;s fine too), but because it&#39;s a a genuinely interesting place to
work. That one&#39;s on us.</p>

        Using OWASP ZAP from the command line
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;m a big fan of <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project">OWASP ZAP</a> or
the Zed Attack Proxy. It&#39;s suprisingly user friendly and nicely pulls of
it&#39;s aim of being useful to developers as well as more hardcore penetration testers.</p>

<p>One of the features I&#39;m particularly fond of is the aforementioned
proxy. Basically it can act as a transparent HTTP proxy, recording the
traffic, and then analyse that to conduct various active security tests;
looking for XSS issues or directory traversal vulnerabilities for
instance. The simplest way of seeding the ZAP with something to analyse is using
the simple inbuilt spider.</p>

<p>So far, so good. Unfortunately ZAP isn&#39;t designed to be used from the
command line. It&#39;s either a thick client, or it&#39;s a proxy with a simple
API. Enter <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr">Zapr</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a pretty simple wrapper around the ZAP API (using the
<a href="https://github.com/vpereira/owasp_zap">owasp_zap</a> library under the
hood). All it does is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launch the proxy in headless mode</li>
<li>Trigger the spider</li>
<li>Launch various attacks against the collected URLs</li>
<li>Print out the results</li>
</ul>

<p>This is fairly limited, in that a spider isn&#39;t going to work
particularly well for a mor interactive application, but it&#39;s a farily good
starting point. I may add different seed methods in the future (or would
happily accept pull requests). Usage wise it&#39;s as simple as:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">zapr --summary http://localhost:3000/
</code></pre></div>
<p>That will print you out something like the following, assuming it finds
an issue.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Alert                             | Risk     | URL                                    |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
| Cross Site Scripting (Reflected)  | High     |http://localhost:3000/forgot_password   |
+-----------------------------------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above alert is taken from a <a href="https://github.com/garethr/zapr-example">simple example</a>,
using the <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/railsgoat">RailsGoat</a> vulnerable web
application as a scape goat. You can see the resulting output from
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/garethr/zapr-example">Travis running the tests</a>.</p>

<p>Zapr is a bit of a proof of concept so it&#39;s not particularly robust or
well tested. Depending on usage and interest I may tidy it up and extend
it, or I may leave it as a useful experiment and try and finally get ZAP
support into <a href="http://gauntlt.org">Gauntlt</a>, only time will tell.</p>

      <a href="/consul/2014/04/25/consul/">
        Consul, DNS and Dnsmasq
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>While at <a href="http://craft-conf.com/2014">Craft</a> I decided to have a quick look at
<a href="http://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, a new service discovery framework with
a few intersting features. One of the main selling points is a DNS
interface with a nice API. The <a href="http://www.consul.io/intro/index.html">Introduction</a>
shows how to use this via the dig command line tool, but how do you use
a custom internal DNS server without modifying all your applications?
One answer to this question is
<a href="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html">Dnsmasq</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not explaining Consul here, the above mentioned introduction does a
good job of stepping through the setup. The following assumes you have
installed and started consul.</p>

<h2>Installation and configuration</h2>

<p>I&#39;m running these examples on an Ubuntu 14.04 machine, but dnsmasq
should be available and packaged for lots of different operating
systems.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt-get install dnsmasq
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once installed we can create a very simple configuration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&quot;</span> &gt; /etc/dnsmasq.d/10-consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>All we&#39;re doing here is specifying that DNS requests for consul services
are to be dealt with by the DNS server at 127.0.0.1 on port 8600. Unless
you&#39;ve changed the consul defaults this should work.</p>

<p>Just in case you prefer Puppet their is already a handy
<a href="https://github.com/saz/puppet-dnsmasq">dnsmasq</a> module. The resulting
puppet code then looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="k">include</span> <span class="na">dnsmasq</span>
<span class="na">dnsmasq</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="na">conf</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;consul&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="na">ensure</span>  <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="k">present</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">content</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;server=/consul/127.0.0.1#8600&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The examples from the main documentation specify a custom DNS server for
dig like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig @127.0.0.1 -p <span class="m">8600</span> web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>With Dnsmasq installed and configured as above you should just be able
to do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">dig web.service.consul
</code></pre></div>
<p>And now any of your existing applications will be able to use your
consul instance for service discovery via DNS.</p>

        Testing Vagrant runs with Cucumber
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Mar 2014</span>

    <p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> since it&#39;s
initial release and still find myself using it for various tasks.</p>

<p>Recently I&#39;ve been using it to test collections of Puppet modules. For a
single host
<a href="https://github.com/jvoorhis/vagrant-serverspec">vagrant-serverspec</a> is
excellent. Simply install the plugin, add a provisioner and write your
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">serverspec</a> tests. The serverspec provisioner
looks like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:serverspec</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">spec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pattern</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;*_spec.rb&#39;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>But I also found myself wanting to test behaviour from the host
(serverspec tests are run on the guest), and also wanted to write tests
that checked the behaviour of a multi-box setup. I started by simply
writing some <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> tests which I ran locally,
but I decided I wanted this integrated with vagrant. Enter
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrant-cucumber-host">vagrant-cucumber-host</a>.
This implements a new vagrant provisioner which runs a set of cucumber
features locally.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:cucumber</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">cucumber</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">features</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Just drop your features in the features folder and run <code>vagrant
provision</code>. If you just want to run the cucumber features, without any
of the other provisioners running you can use:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">vagrant provision --provision-with cucumber
</code></pre></div>
<p>Another advantage of writing this as a vagrant plugin is that it uses
the Ruby bundled with vagrant, meaning you just install the plugin
rather than faff about with a local Ruby install. </p>

<p>A couple of other vagrant plugins that I&#39;ve used to make the testing
setup easier are <a href="https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater">vagrant-hostsupdater</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts">vagrant-hosts</a>. Both
help with managing hosts files, which makes writing tests without
knowing the IP addresses easier.</p>

        Buy vs Build your Monitoring System
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Feb 2014</span>

    <p>At the excellent <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/info/developer-blog/2014/feb/15/london-devops-meetup-held-at-the-guardian">London Devops meetup</a> last week I asked what was
apparently a controversial question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>should you just use software as a service monitoring products rather than integrate lots of open source tools?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got a few people worked up and I promised a blog post.</p>

<p>Note that I wrote a post listing lots of <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2013/10/13/looking-into-monitoring-and-logging-tools/">open source monitoring tools</a>
not that long ago. And I&#39;ve been to both the
<a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> events about open source
monitoring. And have a bunch of <a href="http://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr?q=monitoring">Puppet modules for open source monitoring tools</a>. I&#39;m
a fan of both open source and of open source monitoring. Please don&#39;t
read this as an attack on either, and particularly on the work of
awesome people working on  great open source monitoring products.</p>

<h2>Some assumptions</h2>

<ol>
<li>No one product exists that does everything. I think this is true for
SaaS as much as for open source.</li>
<li>Lets work with about 200 hosts. This is a somewhat arbitrary number I
know, some people will have more and others less.</li>
<li>If it saves money we&#39;ll pay yearly, rather than monthly or hourly.</li>
<li>We could probably get some volume discounts from some of the
suppliers, but we&#39;ll use list prices for this post.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Show me the money</h2>

<p>So what would it cost to get up and running with a state of the art
software as a service monitoring system? In order to do this we need to
choose our software. For this post that means I&#39;m going to pick products
I&#39;ve used (sometimes only a bit) and like. This isn&#39;t a comprehensive
study of all the alternatives I&#39;m afraid - though feel free to write
your own alternative blog posts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> provides a crazy amount of data about
the running of both your servers and your applications. This includes
application performance data, errors, low level metrics and even rolled
up method or database query performance. $149 per host per month for our
200 hosts gives us <em>$29,800</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metrics.librato.com">Librato Metrics</a> provides a fantastic way
of storing arbitrary time series data. We&#39;re already storing lots of
data in New Relic but Metrics provides us with less opinionated software
so we can use it for anything, for instance number of logins or searches
or other business level metrics. We&#39;ll go for a plan with 200 data sources, 100 metrics each and at 10 second resolution for a cost of <em>$3,860</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.pagerduty.com/">Pagerduty</a> is all about the alerts side of
monitoring. Most of the other SaaS tools we&#39;ve chosen integrate with it
so we can make sure we get actionable emails and SMS messages to the
right people at the right time. Our plan costs $18 per person per month, 
so lets say we have 30 people at a cost of <em>$540</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://papertrailapp.com/">Papertrail</a> is all about logs. Simple setup
your servers with syslog and Papertrail will collect, analyze and store
all your log messages. You get a browser based interface, search tools
and the ability to setup alerts. We like lots of logs so we&#39;ll have a
plan for 2 weeks of search, 1 year archive and 100GB month of log
traffic. That all costs <em>$575</em> per month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.getsentry.com">Sentry</a> is all about exceptions. We could be
simply logging these and sending them to Papertrail but Sentry provides
tools for tracking and rolling up occurences. We&#39;ll go for a plan with
90 days of history and 200 events per minute at a cost of <em>$199</em> a
month.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.pingdom.com">Pingdom</a> used to provide a very simple
external check service, but now they have added more complex multistage
checks as well as real user monitoring to the basic ping. We&#39;ll choose
the plan with 250 checks, 20 Real User Monitoring sites and 500 SMS
alerts for <em>$107 a month</em>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>How much!</h2>

<p>In total that all comes to <em>$35,080 (£20,922)</em> per month, or
<em>$420,960 (£251,062)</em> per year.</p>

<p>Now the first reaction of lots of people will be <em>that&#39;s a lot of money</em>
and it is. But remember open source isn&#39;t free either. We need to pay
for:</p>

<ul>
<li>The servers we run our monitoring software on</li>
<li>The people to operate those servers</li>
<li>The people to install and configure our monitoring software</li>
<li>The office space and other costs of employing people (like management
and hiring)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think people with the ability to build software tend to forget they
are expensive, whether as a contractor or as a full time member of
staff. And people without management experience tend to forget costs
like insurance, rent, management overhead, recruitment, etc.</p>

<p>And probably more important than these for some people we need to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>The time taken to build a good open source monitoring system</li>
</ul>

<p>The time needed to put together a good monitoring stack based on for
instance logstash, kibana, riemann, sensu, graphite and collectd isn&#39;t
small. And don&#39;t forget the number of other moving parts like redis,
rabbitmq and elasticsearch that need installing configuring and
maintaining. That probably means compromising in the short term or
shipping later. In a small team how core is building your monitoring
stack to what you do as a business?</p>

<h2>But I can&#39;t use SaaS</h2>

<p>For some people, using a software as a service product just isn&#39;t going
to cut it. Here&#39;s a list of reasons I can think of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Regulation constrains where your data can be stored, for instance it&#39;s
not allowed out of the country</li>
<li>Sheer size of infrastructure, although you may be able to get a volume
discount it might not be enough</li>
</ul>

<p>I think everything else is a cost/benefit issue or personal preference
(or bias). Happy to add more to that list, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a very
long list.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve purposefully not talked about the quality of the tools here, just
the cost. I&#39;ve also not mentioned that it&#39;s likely not an all or nothing
decision, lots of people will mix SaaS products and open source tools.</p>

<p>Whether taking a SaaS approach will be quicker, cheaper or better will
depend on your specific business context. But try and make that about
the organisation and not about the technology.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve never used the current crop of SaaS monitoring
tools (and not just the one&#39;s mentioned above) then I think you&#39;re missing
out. Even if you stick with a mainly open source monitoring stack you
might look at your tools a bit differently after you&#39;ve experimented
with some of the commercial competition.</p>
