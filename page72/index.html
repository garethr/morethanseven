    <span class="post-date">27 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>Well, that&#8217;s nearly 2005 over and done with. Quite an eventful year all told and I couldn&#8217;t let it end without the obligatory <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/12/web_design_and_development_trends_for_2006/">next</a> <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/come-with-me-on-a-journey">year</a> <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/12/13/mollys-unabashedly-biased-picks-2005-blogs-design-books-and-achievements/">post</a> .</p>
 <p>So without further ado, this year various things happened to me:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.atmedia2005.co.uk">@media</a> was great. Met <a href="http://mrpatto.com/">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.molly.com/">nice</a> <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">people</a> and had a blast. Roll on next year.</li>
  <li>I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/thnking-about-a-move">moved jobs</a></li>
  <li>I actually started blogging. I redesigned the site around that goal and now I&#8217;m hooked. Oh well.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com">Reboot</a> was a massive success. It got me to redo my site properly, got me all of ten minutes of minor fame and I&#8217;m still on the front page. Thanks to everyone.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Next year my crystal ball predicts:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/index.html">Carson Workshops Summit</a> will be huge.</li>
  <li>I&#8217;ll find something more specific to write about rather than jumping around all the time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> will kick into action with some real world meetups and then who knows?</li>
</ul>
 <p>On less of a self centred trip:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.nwpropertysolutions.com">Elastic</a> and <a href="http://www.cssliquid.com">Liquid</a> design will be essential.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/yahoo_vs_google_an_academics_vs_inthetrenches_entrepreneurs_showdown_.php">Yahoo Vs Google</a> will really hot up. With more buying and innovating that you can shake a stick at.</li>
  <li>Intel powered Apples will be launch to a crazy ipod fueled public. Who still wont buy them. They will however by the machine of choice for the discerning conference attending web design geek next year.</li>
  <li>Some crazy, web 2.0, buzzword compliant <span class="caps">CMS</span>/Blogging software will hit the streets causing a ruckus. Textpattern will still be great.</li>
  <li>Some cools stuff has to come out of <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/WebInfoService.html">Alexa opening up their archive via web services</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>All in all, I&#8217;m looking forward to next year for a range of reasons including the above. Hope to see (or meet) all of you (again) over the coming year.</p>

    <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2005</span>

    <p><strong>Update</strong> I&#8217;ve updated this site to include a list of recent comments I&#8217;ve made powered by <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and @commented-on. A quick hack of the <a href="http://textpattern.org/plugins/163/txpicious">txt.icio.us</a> plugin and some thinking on at rules for del.icio.us later and their we go. Expect more details soon.</p>
 <p><strong>Update</strong> <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk">Ben</a> has posted an <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/follow-me-with-delicious/">update to his post</a> with a quick hack of the <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> bookmarklet.</p>
 <p>Ah Ha. Nice when you have a vague need and think about spending some time coming up with a quick solution, only to forget about it until you come across a solution.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m busy (ok sometimes) but only part of that is down to my blog reading habit. I only occasionally find time to comment and then often forget where I&#8217;ve commented and no doubt miss the follow up. If only their was a quick way of keeping track. Where did I comment and when? What if (strange, probably stalkerish) people wanted to know where I had been commenting and what I&#8217;d been saying? Well thanks to <a href="http://www.ben-ward.co.uk">Ben</a> we may have a solution.</p>
 <p>Enter <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. Ben has suggested using the tag <code>commented-on and who am I to argue? By tagging any page I make a comment on in this way del.icio.us will keep a record at &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/garethr/</code>commented-on&quot;&gt;del.icio.us/garethr/<code>commented-on&lt;/a&gt; as well as make a feed available at &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/garethr/</code>commented-on&quot;&gt;del.icio.us/rss/garethr/@commented-on</a></p>
 <p>Nothing on those at the moment but as I comment on things around the web I&#8217;ll try and remember. The whole <a href="http://flock.com">flock</a> thing would be particularly useful for this (at least once it&#8217;s a bit more stable) with it&#8217;s built in del.icio.us setup. A couple of apps spring to mind on that back of this, and playing with rss is still one of my fave things. A textpattern plugin (I&#8217;ve been meaning to at least have a look at building one at some point) or some social network app would be interesting. Watch this space (maybe).</p>
 <p>Anyone else start using this technique leave a comment. I&#8217;d be interested to see it catch on.</p>

        A meetup and a quick review
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>Well last week or so the <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> list kicked into life once again with a flurry of posts (some of a sickening nature regarding future rock star Nathan Hardwick). After a suggestion to have a look at <a href="http://www.meetwithapproval.com/">meetwithapproval.com</a> (more on in a moment) we finally got round to organising a proper meetup.</p>
 <p>The date has been set as the 12th of January 2006. The location as <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=bridge+hotel+NE1&#38;ll=54.969026,-1.609701&#38;spn=0.008845,0.023606&#38;iwloc=A&#38;iwstate2=page%3Abasics&#38;hl=en">The Bridge Hotel</a> and the time around 17:45.</p>
 <p>So anyone in the area fancy coming along feel free. The plan is nothing formal. Lots of people have lots of ideas from organising a full blown conference to a vaguely regular meetup. My feeling is that anything we can do to help build a sense of community can only be a good think &#8211; what to do with the website and education are on the top of my list in reality. The latter both in terms of learning from everyone else and hopefully giving back. I&#8217;d like to get some sort of response to the Local Uni&#8217;s web coursess as well, something me and <a href="http://xlab.co.uk">Phil</a> discussed a while back.</p>
 <p>With regard to <a href="http://www.meetwithapproval.com/">meetwithapproval</a> we used it and organised something so there you go. A success. However it had a wide range of little bits that didn&#8217;t quite work or things that appeared missing &#8211; plus no documentaion I could see. I&#8217;m going to note them down here, but before I do I&#8217;d like to say it&#8217;s not in a vengeful sort of a way. I&#8217;d much rather be using web applications like this (in <a href="http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/">Beta</a> if you must) now rather than the finished, untested things in six months. Ok, here goes:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A few people using the service could not, try as they might, mark them selves as accepted. Not sure on browser type and version &#8211; sorry.</li>
  <li>In setting up the event I wasn&#8217;t really sure what was going to happen. The email that was sent to people didn&#8217;t really tell the recipients about the service as I didn&#8217;t include that in the description. A separate box for email message would be handy here.</li>
  <li>A nicer memorable event url would be good, rather than the long numeric string.</li>
  <li><span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for comments and acceptances and date suggestions are an absolute must and would make the app far more useful.</li>
  <li>Some badges would be nice. I&#8217;m going to&#8230; and so are&#8230; type things. Good way of promoting the service too.</li>
  <li>When I confirmed the event I was not aware that it would immediately close comments and acceptances from people. I just thought that it would mean the event was definately on. I found this misleading. I think some more explanation and fine grained control would be nice here. If the event was going to move later on then I&#8217;d need to set up a brand new event.</li>
  <li>Maybe cancel does what I&#8217;m describing but I&#8217;m not wanting to press it incase it emails everyone telling them not to bother coming.</li>
</ul>
 <p>As I mentioned I hope the people <a href="http://www.thissideup.co.uk/">behind</a> the app dont take this the wrong way. I&#8217;ll love to keep using it in the future and with a couple of improvements (especially the <span class="caps">RSS</span> and documentation) I can see a nice future. Maybe a nice <acronym title="Application Programmer Interface"><span class="caps">API</span></acronym> as well? Any other comments or suggestions leave a comment.</p>
 <p>Anyone coming along on the 12th as well who feels like saying hi, or getting going early leave a comment too.</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>It&#8217;s nearly that time of year again where all of us working types get more than a week off work (the students amongst you are probably already on holiday, or at least acting like you are).</p>
 <p>As well as all the obvious things everyone will be up to I always try and have some sort of computer project on the go. Something I can have a proper run at over the festive period. New language. Application. New site. You get the idea.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m intrigued to see if that&#8217;s just me? Is everyone else thinking &#8220;No computer for a week!&#8221; or similar? Or has anyone got any exciting projects on the go, and fancy letting us in on a little secret.</p>
 <p>Needless to say I&#8217;ll have more on what I&#8217;m up to nearer the time but obviously it will start in <a href="http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/">beta</a> and if I&#8217;m really pushing the boat out I&#8217;ll set up an AJAXified sign up page and maybe an <a href="http://measuremap.com/">invitation only</a> period. I might just be mocking others here but maybe not, time will tell.</p>

        Tips for fluid design II
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>A while back I decided to jot down a couple of practical, simple techniques that have served me well when actually building fluid designs.</p>
 <p>One of the situations that often comes up is the need to make an elements width vary. This is no problem when that element is a block level element (say a div or a paragraph) as unless you tell them otherwise their width willl vary with the space available. However, when it comes to graphics this can be a problem. After all, these will (probably) have been designed with a fixed size in mind.</p>
 <p>Their are a couple of possible solutions here, both useful in different circumstances. However, both rely on the image itself to some extent.</p>
 <p>The sometimes obvious method is using the <span class="caps">CSS</span> <em>background</em> rules, the image wont actually be part of the page and so wont take up any space, the size of the image can then be controlled by the size of the element (say a div) on which the background image is placed. This works but has a couple of ugly side effects &#8211; if the image is content based (ie. it carries some sort of important message rather than being just for it&#8217;s asthetic attributes) then placing it in the <span class="caps">CSS</span> removes it from the page completely, not good for those without <span class="caps">CSS</span> support. Another consequence is in site management. Having content imagery in the <span class="caps">CSS</span> can make life a little tricky.</p>
 <p>The second approach involves using the <span class="caps">CSS</span> overflow property. By wrapping the inline image with a container (again, maybe a div) and assigning this an <em>overflow: hidden</em> we can control the viewable area of the image by controlling the size of the surrounding div (with <span class="caps">CSS</span>, natch). An example of this can be seen on these pages, with the favourite sites and flickr images. Resize the window. These images should expand to fill the available space.</p>
 <p>OK, so we have added some additional markup to the page, depending on your feelings on this that solution may be fine. Want to go a bit further? What about assigning a class to the image and using some nifty <span class="caps">DOM</span> scripting to add in the additional markup?</p>
