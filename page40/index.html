    <p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> lets you run virtual machines in headless mode. Which is pretty handy if you&#8217;re using a Linux VM to mirror your live environment. The strange thing is that it&#8217;s not enabled by default. To enable it you need to run the following on your console: <code>defaults write com.vmware.fusion fluxCapacitor -bool YES</code></p>

        Django Admin Options 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>Working on a decent sized Django project at work means I&#8217;ve found myself delving into Django&#8217;s admin interface more than a few times. Although it&#8217;s always possible to just use a custom template and do everything yourself it&#8217;s nearly always easier and often quicker to use the generated admin views. One of the problems with that is, even with therecent 1.0 release, some of the options are not that well documented outside the source code or in posts buried on mailing lists.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll assume a little bit of familiarity with the new-forms-admin way of doing things which is now the default in Django 1.0. If you&#8217;re just getting started with building Django sites then you might want to first have a look at a tutorial or two. It&#8217;s quite different to the examples found in the original Django book or older online tutorials but it&#8217;s also much more powerful and flexible with a better separation of concerns.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll start off with a very simple model in models.py which defines a simple Article class with a couple of fields.</p>
<pre>from django.db import models
class Article(models.Model):    
    	title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
	content = models.TextField()
	publish_date = models.DateTimeField(default=datetime.today)</pre>
<p>Django 1.0 introduced the concept of admin autodiscovery. By playing your admin declarations in admin.py in an application (most likely next to models.py and views.py) you can tell django to find these automatically. To enable auto loading of admin modules you can add the following to your urls.py.</p>
<p>.pre from django.contrib import admin<br />
admin.autodiscover()</p>
<p>This will load the module admin.py for each of the apps in the installed apps list. Now Lets add an admin class in your admin.py to go with the above models.py. We&#8217;ll call it ArticleAdmin:</p>
<pre>from django.contrib import admin
from models import Article
class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	pass
admin.site.register(Article, ArticleAdmin)</pre>
<p>The important line is the last one, in which we register the admin for the Article class. This will display the relevant admin views in the Django admin for that model &#8211; allowing us to add new articles, list existing ones and delete old ones. But by default the admin is quite sparse.</p>
<p>Once we have a few articles in the system we&#8217;ll find it hard to find them again. Lets add a few more lines to our admin.py file:</p>
<pre>class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	list_display=('title', 'publish_date')
	ordering = ['-publish_date']
	list_per_page = 25
	search_fields = ['title','content']
	date_hierarchy = 'publish_date'</pre>
<p>Lets step though each of these statements and see what we&#8217;ve done:</p>
<ul>
	<li>setting <em>list_display</em> for the title and publish_date means these two fields will appear in the changelist. This is the view you get when you hit Articles in the admin and allows you to find the article you are looking for.</li>
	<li><em>ordering</em> is self explanatory, in that we choose to order the items in the changelist by the publish_date rather than the auto generated numeric id.</li>
	<li><em>list_per_page</em> is another straightforward option, setting the maximum number of articles to show in the changelist before the list starts paging over multiple pages.</li>
	<li><em>search_fields</em> adds a simple search to the changelist, the fields specified set which fields to search; title and content in this case.</li>
	<li><em>date_hierarchy</em> is great when you have a date associated with an object. This outputs a separate filter list which displays the years by which to filter. The option you pass to this setting is the field name which stores the date.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simple example above hopefully demonstrates the ease of which the admin can be configured. Knowing about these capabilities already built into Django can save you quite a bit of time when it comes to producing production ready admin interfaces. Except for more complex systems this should suffice. Below is a table of the Django admin options I&#8217;ve been using. If anyone has any more let me know and I&#8217;ll add them here, along with a brief description.</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Option</td>
		<td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>model</td>
		<td> Set the model for which this is the admin </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>form</td>
		<td> Set the form class if one has been created </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>list_display</td>
		<td> Set which fields should appear in the changelist view </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>list_filter</td>
		<td> Se which fields should be used to provide a filter in the changelist view </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>raw_id_field</td>
		<td> Useful when you have a Foreign Key on another model with lots of records. This changes the default interface from the a select box to a custom widget</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>ordering</td>
		<td> Specify the order of the objects in the changelist </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>fieldset</td>
		<td> Fieldsets allow for control over the changeform view, setting which fields to display and whether to separate them out into individual fieldsets. Worth investigating </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>save_on_top</td>
		<td> If you have a long form it&#8217;s useful to be able to display the save buttons at the top as well as the bottom </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>date_hierachy</td>
		<td> Add date based filtering to the chaneglist view </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>radio_fields</td>
		<td> Another alternative widget for Foreign key fields, this time using radio buttons. Useful for fixed small lists of objects </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>list_per_page</td>
		<td> How may objects to list per page on the changelist view </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>search_fields</td>
		<td> Enable search for the model and specify which fields to search </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>prepopulated_fields</td>
		<td> Some fields might be prepopulated based on the user entering text into another field. This is often used to prepopulate slugs based on the title of an object </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>filter_horizontal</td>
		<td> The default widget for many to many fields is the rather shoddy multiple select box. Filter horizontal enhances this with some super javascript, making it much more usable. Never use many to many fields without this or filter_vertical </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>filter_vertical</td>
		<td> Does exactly the same as filter_horizontal, except the filter lists appear one above the other rather than side to side. Useful for thinner admin views</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>As you can see you can customise the default admin views a great deal even without creating your own templates and defining custom admin views. The best part is still that as well as being useful for demonstrations and prototypes these interfaces are useful on a live production site. Quite an achievement I think.</p>

        Using Python and Stompserver to Get Started With Message Queues
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>Message Queues are cool. It&#8217;s official. Now, banks and financial institutions have been using big Enterprise Java message systems for years. But it&#8217;s only really over the last year or two that the web community at large have got interested. Wonder what all the interest is in Erlang, Scala or Haskell? Distributed systems and a lack of shared state &#8211; hopefully leading to some sort of scalability nirvana &#8211; that&#8217;s what.</p>
<p>Matt Biddulph of Dopplr has spoken at varying levels of technical detail on the subject over the last year or so. At <a href="http://adamcohenrose.blogspot.com/2007/11/messaging-scales-matt-biddulph.html">barcamps</a> and more recently at <a href="http://2008.dconstruct.org/">dconstruct</a>. But you still don&#8217;t find that many people actually starting to use any of this stuff. Looking around the internet I couldn&#8217;t find that many examples of how to get started. Their are some pretty mature standards, good libraries, server interoperability, but few tutorials aimed at people who don&#8217;t know all about it.</p>
<p>The first problem is looking for a simple use case that most developers will have experienced problems with. The example I like to give is sending email. If you have a simple form on your site that sends email you probably just submit the request to the backend, it sends the email and then renders the success page back to the user. The problem here comes with scale. How many connections can your mailserver sustain? How many emails can you send from it before you start looking like you&#8217;ve been turned into a spam factory? At what point does the time taken for the mail server to respond to the web server cause the web server to time out or respond so slowly the user left or pressed refresh? If you&#8217;re sending lots of emails you need to think about this sort of stuff. For your average site this might not be a problem, but for the newer breed of applications or social networks this might bite you sooner than you think. You can gain more control over this process by introducing a message queue. Submitting the form simply adds a work task to the queue. A listener reads from the queue and sends the email. The advantage comes when you realise by removing the rendering of the page form the same process as sending the email you can throttle the system without affecting page rendering time.</p>
<p>So onto a simple working example. I&#8217;ve decided to use Python as that&#8217;s my language of choice at the moment. It&#8217;s also easy to read in a -sudo-<ins>pseudo</ins> code sort of way. Writing these examples using equivalent libraries in Ruby or <span class="caps">PHP</span> should be straightforward enough. As for the message queue itself I&#8217;ve opted for <a href="http://stompserver.rubyforge.org/">stompserver</a> which is available as a Ruby gem. So assuming you have Ruby and gem installed (good instructions for this on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/GettingStartedWithRails">Rails wiki</a>) you can just run:</p>
<pre><code>sudo gem install stompserver</code></pre>
<p>Starting the queue is as simple as running:</p>
<pre><code>stompserver</code></pre>
<p>This will get you up and running quickly. Stompserver has a number of arguments you can pass in to use different ports or backends but for the purposes of getting started it&#8217;s enough to just run it. This ease of use is the thing I love about stompserver. ApacheMQ is something of a tricky beast to setup, though you might want to use that in a production environment.</p>
<p>So now we have the server up and running we can get on with talking to it. I used the Python <a href="http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/projects/stomppy/">stomp.py</a> library to deal with the heavy lifting. All the other modules are in the standard library. Their are equivalents for <a href="http://stomp.codehaus.org/PHP"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a> and <a href="http://stomp.codehaus.org/Ruby+Client">Ruby</a> available as well.</p>
<p>The first script is a listener. Its job is to listen for activity on the queue and then act upon it. You pass the script an argument of the name of the queue to listen to.</p>
<pre><code>./stomp_listen.py /queue/test</code></pre>
<p>This example simply prints the messages from the queue to the console, but in reality the on_message handler would be were you act upon the message received. In our email example above it would be were you parse out the email address, subject line and message and actually send the email.</p>
<p>Stompserver currently exposes a queue for monitoring the queue server at <em>/queue/monitor</em>. You can use this script to subscribe to that queue and get information about the current state of the server. It will tell you which queues currently have items in them and if these are currently being processed.</p>
<p>You can run multiple instances of this script subscribing to a single queue. This is one of the real advantage of message based systems, two listeners should clear a queue in half the time. This sort of horizontal scaling is hugely useful as you grow a site or application.</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python
import time
import sys
import logging
import socket
import stomp
# the stomp module uses logging so to stop it complaining
# we initialise the logger to log to the console
logging.basicConfig()
# first argument is the que path
queue = sys.argv[1]
# defaults for local stompserver instance
hosts=[('localhost', 61613)]
# we want the script to keep running
def run_server():
    while 1:
        time.sleep(20)
class listener(object):
    '''define the event handlers'''
    # if we recieve an error from the server
    def on_error(self, headers, message):
        print 'received an error %s' % message
    # if we retrieve a message from the server
    def on_message(self, headers, message):
        print 'received a message %s' % message
# do we have a connection to the server?
connected = False
while not connected:
    # try and connect to the stomp server
    # sometimes this takes a few goes so we try until we succeed
    try:
        conn = stomp.Connection(host_and_ports=hosts)
        # register out event hander above
        conn.add_listener(listener())
        conn.start()
        conn.connect()
        # subscribe to the names que
        conn.subscribe(destination=queue, ack='auto')
        connected = True
    except socket.error:
        pass
# we have a connection so keep the script running
if connected:
    run_server()</pre>
<p>The second script allows us to send messages to the queue:</p>
<pre><code>./stomp_send.py /queue/test "test message 1"</code></pre>
<p>The script takes a couple of arguments, the first one is the name of the queue, the second is the message you want to send.</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/python
import time
import sys
import logging
import socket
import stomp
# the stomp module uses logging so to stop it complaining
# we initialise the logger to log to the console
logging.basicConfig()
# first argument is the queue
queue = sys.argv[1]
# second argument is the message to send
message = sys.argv[2]
# defaults for local stompserver instance
hosts=[('localhost', 61613)]
# do we have a connection to the server?
connected = False
while not connected:
    try:
        # connect to the stompserver
        conn = stomp.Connection(host_and_ports=hosts)
        conn.start()
        conn.connect()
        # send the message
        conn.send(message,destination=queue)    
        # disconnect from the stomp server
        conn.disconnect()
        connected = True
    except socket.error:
        pass</pre>
<p>Both these scripts are pretty simple examples. In the real world you would probably want to make them a little more robust and user friendly. Both could probably do with checking they have the relevant arguments and providing help information if you run them without. I&#8217;d also probably move the hosts into a config file as it&#8217;s currently hardcoded into the scripts. I&#8217;ve also not tested them with other stomp compatible servers like ApacheMQ. In theory they should work fine assuming stomp.py works as advertised.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s surprisingly easy to get started with message queues. If you&#8217;ve been hearing about the advantages of distributed message based architectures but assumed you had to be <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/">Matt Biddulph</a> to use them, think again.</p>
