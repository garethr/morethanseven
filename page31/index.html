        XMPP and Queues in App Engine via Jaiku? Not quite yet
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2009</span>

    <p>So <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine">JauikuEngine</a>, the open source, App Engine based, version of Jaiku is now available for everyone to look at. I <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr/status/1321372099">found the repo a couple of days ago</a> but it was restricted to project members. The main reason I want to hunt through the code is to have a look at what I&#8217;m guessing will be API&#8217;s available in a soon to be released version of App Engine &#8211; with specific interest in anything to do with <span class="caps">XMPP</span>, queues and offline processing.</p>
<p>Well it looks like I&#8217;m out of luck for the moment at least. In the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/source/browse/trunk/settings.py">settings file</a> I found the following two snippets though:</p>
<pre>#
# XMPP / IM
#
# Enabling IM will require a bit more than just making this True, please
# read the docs at http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support
IM_ENABLED = False
# This is the id (JID) of the IM bot that you will use to communicate with
# users of the IM interface
IM_BOT = 'root@example.com'
# Turn on test mode for IM
IM_TEST_ONLY = False
# JIDs to allow when testing live XMPP so you don't spam all your users
IM_TEST_JIDS = []</pre>
<p>And another for queues:</p>
<pre>#
# Task Queue
#
# Enabling the queue will allow you to process posts with larger numbers
# of followers but will require you to set up a cron job that will continuously
# ping a special url to make sure the queue gets processed
QUEUE_ENABLED = True
# The secret to use for your cron job that processes your queue
QUEUE_VENDOR_SECRET = 'SECRET'</pre>
<p>The only problem appears to be that the page referenced, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support">code.google.com/p/jaikuengine/wiki/im_support</a>, currently says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><acronym title="termie"><span class="caps">TODO</span></acronym>: describe how to get IM working with Jaiku Engine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So <a href="http://twitter.com/termie">termie</a>, or anyone else on the inside, I&#8217;d love to know how to get this up and running?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be having a better look through the code when I get a chance. This was just the first thing I jumped on before heading out the door. I love Open Source.</p>

        Services Vs Applications: Does Rails Encourage SOA Better Than Django?

    <p>Building larger applications tends to mean splitting your codebase up some how into manageable chunks. I&#8217;m quite interested in what I see as different approaches in the Rails and Django communities:</p>
<p>Django tends to recommend building <a href="http://www.b-list.org/weblog/2007/mar/27/reusable-django-apps/">Reusable Apps</a> and we have sites like <a href="http://djangoplugables.com/">Django Pluggables</a> to catalog what&#8217;s available. You then grab a few of these applications from the web or write your own, add them run them all together as part of a single application. <a href="http://pinaxproject.com/">Pinax</a> is probabaly the poster child for this approach. The  0.5.1 release for instance appears to have 41 individual reusable apps, many written by other people and projects.</p>
<p>The Rails community tends to <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/08/activeresource-rails-scalability.html">talk more about RESTful service orientated architectures</a>, with things like <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource/Base.html">ActiveResource</a> making this sort of thing easier. So rather than your manageable chunks being within your application they&#8217;re separate instances in their own right.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested in hearing from more people about their experiences, in particular if you&#8217;ve gone against the grain so to speak.</p>

    <p>Not sure how I missed this but apparently App Engine (as of 1.1.9) supports <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html">remote access to your live data store</a>. This means you can create administration applications more easily by running them locally, rather than within the limitations of the live platform. You can even run a local python prompt with access to your live datastore which is pretty neat.</p>

    <span class="post-date">09 Mar 2009</span>

    <p><a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">RewiredState</a> was awesome. 100 or so geeks plus a smattering of government types gathered in the shiny new Guardian offices in Kings Cross on Saturday to hack (the Government).</p>
<p>Some events like this are more productive than others, and the end of day demos included some realy impressive stuff. See for your self on the <a href="http://projects.rewiredstate.org/">projects page</a></p>
<p>My own little project even won a prize (an invisible bottle of Champagne no less). My complain was that if you want to report an issue about the over 7000 government websites you have to do it per site. All of the sites do their own thing, which might be a nice contact form, maybe an email address or in some cases a postal address hidden on a page that&#8217;s not linked to from anywhere.</p>
<p>My solution was pretty simple &#8211; a centralised issue reporting and navigating tool. So you go along to the site you have an issue with and hit a bookmarklet (or a badge on the site if the site in question have been nice enough to add one). You fill in a very simple form which appears before your eyes and everything is tracked on a nice shiny website.</p>
<p>The advantage of all that is transparency. You can see which sites people have issue with, and also ideally which issues get addresses or at least acknowledged by the support staff for the site in question. The hack had comments so others could follow up on individual issues. It would be simple enough to have league tables and the like as well, or add tagging for a little bit of categorisation &#8211; I did only have a few hours though.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRi7Fww" alt="screenshot of FeedbackGov website"/></p>
<p>After a few nice comments I&#8217;m going to have to finish it off and get it up somewhere I think. All I really need to do is clean up the bookmarklet code (which was a hack in more ways than one) and add a bit of sanity checking to data entered into the system.</p>
<p>A massive well done to everyone involved is in order as well, especially <a href="http://coupde.com/">James</a> who I remember talking to the idea about ages ago. Congratulations all &#8211; and hopefully be back next year.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a> just released an excellent little <a href="http://www.phpied.com/content-to-markup-ratio-bookmarklet/">bookmarklet to calculate a content to markup ratio</a></p>
