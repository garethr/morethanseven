    <p>After <a href="http://andybudd.com">complains</a> of the lack of a decent magazine, and after the passing and resurection of Design in Flight another one raised it&#8217;s head. Yeh. Have a look at <a href="http://particletree.com/treehouse/">treehouse</a>.</p>
 <p>Another great, low cost ($15), well designed publication that you can print out and read in the moments away from the computer.</p>
 <p>OK, so I haven&#8217;t read that much yet but what I have was both interesting, informative and hey, pretty well edited.</p>
 <p>Thumbs up to any and all involved.</p>

        Are kids being taught web standards? II
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2005</span>

    <p>Disclaimer: I went to uni but not to study anything even remotely to do with the web. I basically make everything up as I go along. Bear that in mind when reading my commentry.</p>
 <p>Phil (<a href="http://xlab.co.uk">xlab.co.uk</a>) just made an observation regarding webstandards and education that I thought particularly interesting. Are kids being taught web standards?</p>
 <p>Based on my experience, limited as it may be, I&#8217;d have to vote no. I&#8217;d maybe even go further &#8211; are kids (sorry to any young readers, I&#8217;m just going with the flow) being taught web design?</p>
 <p>Web design, at least to my mind, involves a wide range of disciplines &#8211; Human Computer Interaction, Information design and theory, Graphic design, Application design and development and so on and so forth. Without a general appreciation of all of these you are not, again to my thinking, a web designer. That isn&#8217;t to say you aren&#8217;t a fantastic Graphic Designer or what not, but a web designer is simply a broader disciple.</p>
 <p>Back to education. And teaching. Now to teach such a rapidly changing medium? A course, I would imagine, needs planning over three years. The problem their is that in web design and development three years is an awful long time in terms of best practice and up to date thinking. I want to work with people who know <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, real world <span class="caps">CSS</span>, semantic thinking <span class="caps">XHTML</span> and unobtrusive Javascript. That sort of course simply could not have been written 4 years ago. And writing it now will leave it dramatically out of date in 4 years time &#8211; when all we&#8217;ll be wanting is more Python Programmers (or something)</p>
 <p>In a sort of unlikely to get picked up on sticking neck out statement, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;d love to help out. I see the only option is getting the local web industry involved in education. Seminars, chats, meet-ups, anything that get&#8217;s those in education nearer to the reality (yes &#8211; you do have to consider users other than your mates, tutors and design magazines) the better.</p>
 <p>Anyone else out their think the same? Willing to get involved? Maybe the time is now?</p>
 <p>Leave a comment here or on <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk/weblog/602">phil&#8217;s post</a> or post something on your site and lets discuss the issue. Does anyone else feel strongly about this? Even as someone not involved in the recruitment side of things directly at the moment I still want to work with the best &#8211; and in my mind so should everyone else.</p>

    <p>Ok. I just came to a realisation. I think somewhere along the line I got addicted. First I tried one. It seemed pretty good. Not really having any effect on my and generally just being good to feel part of something.</p>
 <p>But I couldn&#8217;t stop at one. I thought I could handle more and more. So I went in for some of the hard stuff. And lots of it.</p>
 <p>And look at me now. Typing this while waiting for more email that is reasonable for a small company in a week to download because I didn&#8217;t check my email for a day or so. Time for rehab I think.</p>
 <p>I dont want to chuck the habit completely, just pair back my addiction, get some control. So who stays and who goes?</p>
 <p>DiH (designersinhouse.com) is certainly leading at the moment as a keeper. It&#8217;s proved useful, interesting and informative so far &#8211; plus I met Matt at @media.</p>
 <p>I think maybe their&#8217;s room for one more. <span class="caps">CSS</span>-d, <span class="caps">WSG</span>, thelist, webdesign-L your time is coming.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been a (distant) admirer of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> since I had a brief play a while back. Nice interface, good idea and all that. Well I finally got round to setting up a proper account.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;d recently got myself a reasonable digital camera. Nothing expensive or fancy &#8211; in the past whenever I&#8217;ve thought about taking photo&#8217;s I&#8217;ve always got bored and given up. This time is going to be different. Hopefully.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve only really got round to one proper shoot and in non ideal conditions (well, in terms of photography &#8211; basically in a room under a pub) but I&#8217;m pretty happy with a couple of the photo&#8217;s. But maybe that&#8217;s because I like somewhat abstract orange/red shots?</p>
 <p>Anyway, hopefully I&#8217;ll get round to taking and uploading some more shots. And maybe using some of them on this site.</p>

        Nice URLs and PHP
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2005</span>

    <p>I all one for nice url&#8217;s, that is removing all the  gumf involving question marks and ampersands and the like for something that is both shorter, more human readable and more search engine friendly.</p>
 <p>Doing it in <span class="caps">PHP</span> is actually pretty straightforward once you get the hang of it and can be pretty powerful &#8211; so here goes with a short tutorial of sorts. It&#8217;s will probably be brief and make too many assumptions of the reader &#8211; any questions just let me know and I may even try and write it up properly.</p>
 <p>The basic principle is to stop using the <span class="caps">GET</span> array (accessible from $_SERVER[&#8216;<span class="caps">GET</span>&#8217;]) to make descisions with. The question then becomes what to replace it with. A simple class borrowed from the <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com">Sitepoint</a> <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpant1/"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Anthology</a> book written by <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/phpant1/about.php">Harry Fuecks</a> is at least my answer. The PathVars class does pretty much what is says in the name, specifically providing access to the path contents in the form of an array. I&#8217;ll provide a link to a <a href="/code/dispatcher.zip">code archive</a> for this article rather than just copy and paste whole classes &#8211; download it now if you are interested in the behind the scenes bits.</p>
 <p>So we now create a new PathVars instance like so:</p>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;
/* Pathvars object */
$pathvars = new PathVars($_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']);
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
 <p>And we can now magically get access to each element of the path (separated by a /) from the instance variable pathvars:</p>
<p><code>$params = $pathvars-&amp;gt;pathVars;</code></p>
 <p>Or more correctly by using the method provided:</p>
<p><code>$pathvars-&amp;gt;fetchByIndex(0)</code></p>
 <p>Where the fetchByIndex parameter is the element you want from the array.</p>
 <p>Ok, so so far I&#8217;m really just repeating the work of others, if you like this sort of thing I&#8217;d really recommend the book. The next step on top of this is however is to decide what to do with the information when you have it. The following shows a very simple example &#8211; potentially for use in a simple blog or news site:</p>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;
switch ($pathvars-&amp;gt;fetchByIndex(0)) {</p>
case &#8220;article&#8221;:
include(views/article.view.php);
case &#8220;page&#8221;:
include(views/page.view.php);
default:
include(&#8216;views/home.view.php&#8217;);
<p>}<br />
</pre><br />
</code></p>
 <p>In this example where we have www.example.com/article or www.example.com/article/a_sample_article_name the article view include file is used.</p>
 <p>What these include files then do is up to you, in my case each of them passes different parameters to a simple templating system which then outputs the page. Again, have a look at the code samples to see that in action.</p>
 <p>Let me know if anyone found this interesting, useful or informative and I might post other titbits, otherwise it&#8217;s probably back to inane ramblings and misplaced conjecture.</p>
