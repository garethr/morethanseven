        Mashup Demo

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2007</span>

    <p><em>Long time no post. Lots of excuses, time away (including a holiday) and work catching up with me. Hopefully expect a few quick fire posts to catch up and then back to normal.</em></p>
<p>I was in London a couple of weeks back, mainly to help out at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com"><span class="caps">FOWA</span></a> (which can get it&#8217;s own post) but also to generally catch up with lots of people about interesting stuff. After using my Monopoly knowledge of London to find the apple store (something some <a href="http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/">Londers</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/rossbruniges/statuses/307080542">took issue with</a>) I heard about an event round the corner thanks to the magic of the internets (in this case <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> and <a href="http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/">Dave Stone</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mashupevent.com/event/mashup-demo">Mashup Demo</a> was billed as &#8220;a simple and effective way for startups, growing businesses, enterprises and corporates to present themselves to an audience of professionals who would include:- investors, media journalists and bloggers, potential partners and industry influencers&#8221;. When first chatting with one of the exhibiting companies they looked me up and down and said &#8220;so, are you a blogger?&#8221;. Apparently I didn&#8217;t look much like a VC. Who knew?</p>
<p>Fifteen lightning presentations made up the bulk of the event, with me taking notes using my handy N800 (another blog post probably), and then followed a good amount of time to wander about and chat with everyone, probably about 100 people all in all. The companies presenting represented lots of the <em>hot topics</em> at the moment shall we say. Anyone not mentioning mobile, or social networking (or both!) had come to the wrong party.</p>
<p>Local Search had a strong showing from <a href="http://welovelocal.com">welovelocal.com</a>, <a href="http://www.rummble.com">Rumble</a>, and <a href="http://www.tipped.co.uk">tipped.co.uk</a>. The thorny problem of local was one of the really interesting discussion topics at the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> innovation labs</a> earlier in the year and it&#8217;s good to see interesting ideas of how to solve it. Although personally I don&#8217;t need <em>another</em> social network and also want to be able to define what I mean by local (not just be given a location, or have it based on a pool of friends, or whatever the latest looking glass is).</p>
<p>Identity was suprisingly popular with both <a href="http://www.bondaii.com">Bondai</a> and <a href="http://www.meecard.com/">meecards</a> talking up their applications. Obviously with all the cool kids playing with <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenId</a> and the alpha geeks tinkering with <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> identity is technologically interesting, but both these companies have spotted commercial opportunities as well. Be interesting to see how this all plays out. I&#8217;ve rambled on before about what I called Banks for Data (as apposed to money, which is just data anyhow when you think about it) but not really considered early movers and entrepreneurs in this sector.</p>
<p>A couple of interesting takes on agregators dropped in as well.<br />
<a href="http://fav.or.it/">fav.or.it</a> was pitched as trying to popularise feeds for everyone else, but looked to me to actually be more of a useful tool for the information hungry crowd. It&#8217;s innovative features (inline commenting looked nice) would likely not be that interesting to people with only a few feeds and a few minutes but for people with hundreds of feeds look interesting. <a href="http://www.magpie.net/brandwatch.html">Brandwatch</a> was similar to an idea a friend and me kicked around a while back, but never put together. Simply put it finds stories relating to your brand (company, product, whatever) and ascertains the importance and whether it&#8217;s positive or negative. You can then track all that over time with useful graphs and charts and the like. At the moment they are indexing about 500,000 sites and it still uses some manual filtering I think. Even so I know of clients past who would definately find the service offered interesting.</p>
<p>A few others caught my eye; an ad network for bloggers based on their blog rolls called <a href="http://www.rollsense.com/">rollSense</a>, a service simliar to <a href="htp://slideshare.com">slideshare</a> but for business documents called &#8220;Edocr&#8221;:&quot;http://www.edocr.com/ and <a href="http://testcard.tv">testcard.tv</a>. Testcard.tv does some really pretty impressive agregation, stitching and searching of online video. Sort of a glimpse of the future, but probably not as pretty. Optimising that for the Wii or PS3 (or keyboard/remote control) would be awesome.</p>
<p>After chatting with a few of the companies, and other people in the crowd, I popped for sushi with the aforementioned Dave for discussions of the freelance life I&#8217;ve got myself in to. The event was pretty darn interesting. That the companies presenting were, for the majority, proper startups was interesting. And the fact the whole event was geared around product centric companies and the surrounding eco-system interested me. I get to similar business events up and around newcastle, but these tend to be more service company orientated it seems. All in all Mashup Demo kicked my stay down in London off nicely.</p>

      <a href="/2007/09/16/getting-going-with-symfony/">
        Getting going with Symfony
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve tinkered with a rather large number of these web application frameworks, in Ruby, Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span> and C#, at some point over the last few years. But I&#8217;ve never really settled on any of them &#8211; mainly because my day job didn&#8217;t need me to and also because I like playing with new toys. I even tinkered with <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/webphp/">my own homage</a> to <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a> in <span class="caps">PHP</span> which a few people have picked and are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wephp/">running with</a>.</p>
<p>Right now though I&#8217;ve been doing some work with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project. Their are some seriously nice things in Rails that I don&#8217;t see elsewhere; really good testing support baked in for one, and some serious deplyments for another.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">Symfony</a> is another <span class="caps">PHP</span> framework but one that only supports PHP5 (a good thing in my book). It&#8217;s basically a slick integration of lots of existing mature <span class="caps">PHP</span> tools plus some good old <span class="caps">MVC</span> and tried and trusted Software Patterns. I also discovered from a few YAHOO&#8217;s that they have started using it on some levels within <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>.</p>
<p>My interest piqued I found a couple of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fullo/federico-feroldi-php-in-yahoo/">related</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dustin.whittle/symfony-yui-professional-web-20">presentations</a> on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> (my new favourite web app), and the site has a <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/book/1_0">high quality online documentation</a> which can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-Symfony-Experts-Source/dp/1590597869">purchased in dead tree format</a>.</p>
<p>Having a play around with Symfony it took me a little while to get everything up and running, but I&#8217;d kept some handy notes for later. Hopefully they might be useful to someone other than me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve dropped in a few variables denoted by braces where relevant. The paths are from my <span class="caps">MAMP</span> and <span class="caps">PEAR</span> based environment and I&#8217;m using a MySQL database, though you could just as easily use Sqlite.</p>
<p>First we set up a virtual host in Apache. You have to do this manually at the moment. I already have a script for setting up virtual hosts under apache on OS X which I might extend to do this for me if I end up using Symfony alot.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;
  ServerName 
  DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/{project}/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  Alias /sf /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf
  &lt;Directory "/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf"&gt;
    AllowOverride All 
    Allow from All</p>
</Directory>
&lt;Directory &#8220;/Applications/<span class="caps">MAMP</span>/htdocs/{project}/web&#8221;&gt;
AllowOverride All
Allow from All
</Directory>
<p></VirtualHost></pre></code></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;cd /www
mkdir {project}
cd {project}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now we dive into the actual symfony commands. We&#8217;ll just setting up both a frontend and a backend for this app which I think is likely to be pretty typical. I quite like the idea of seperate entities for these.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-project {project_name}
symfony init-app frontend
symfony init-module frontend {module_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Next we have to configure our database connection by editing /config/databases.yml</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;all:
    propel:
      class: sfPropelDatabase
      param:
        dsn: mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>That done we can set up our data definitions in <em>/config/schema.yml</em>. Read the documention for all the details but you can probably get the general idea.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel:
 item:
   id:
   title: varchar(200)
   description: longvarchar
   created_at:&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>And yet another quick change in <em>/config/propel.ini</em></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel.database.createUrl = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306
propel.database.url = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The next set of commands build our model files, create <span class="caps">SQL</span> for out chosen database and then create the tables in the database.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony propel-build-model
symfony propel-build-sql
symfony propel-insert-sql&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll quickly create a backend using the scaffolding. Note that <em>item</em> here is the model name which is taken from the <em>schema.yml</em> config file above.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-app backend
symfony propel-generate-crud backend items Item&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>All in all not bad going. And that&#8217;s basically the same for most of the apps you&#8217;re likely to develop. It could probably be a little easier in the database and apache config areas in fairness. Rails&#8217; use of an inbuild webserver really helps here. But the use of <span class="caps">YAML</span> to define the model is, in my mind, more straightforward that using Ruby in Rails migrations. I&#8217;ve an app in the works at the moment and I&#8217;m looking at using Symfony. If that pans out I&#8217;ll blog more about the bits I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; the inbuilt unit testing framework high on my list.</p>

        Brighton Rock(s)

    <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2007</span>

    <p>Back from a madcap weekend in Brighton for the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dconstruct</a> BarCamp Brighton double header. If I was to write down everything I can remember we&#8217;d be here for a week. If I was to write down simply everything then we&#8217;d be here longer still. Information packed just doesn&#8217;t cover it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll likely sort some more detailed posts on some particular topics that piquet my interest in the coming weeks or months, for instance user centred design vs agile methodologies (thanks to <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/">Leisa Reichelt</a>), some more rambling posts on web application frameworks, microformats for write APIs, OAuth and countless other things I&#8217;ve no doubt forgotten.</p>
<p>One thing you can get now is my BarCamp presention which I&#8217;ve uploaded to <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>. I&#8217;ve not used this much previously but I&#8217;m smitten and will be uploading a few other past presentions in the next few weeks as soon as I can find them. If you&#8217;re interested in RESTful architectures or Rabbits then this might float your boat:</p>
<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" /></object></p>
<p>I also took lots of photos (some with <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm&#8217;s</a> very nice 1.4f 50mm lens, thanks Norm) whick I&#8217;ll get on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> when I get a moment. Expect lots of portraits of people (maybe including you?) for once instead of odd abstract architecture and textures.</p>
<p>Final thing I&#8217;ll say for now is a big thankyou to anyone or everyone who sorted all this out. The 600-700 geeks descending on brighton all got fed, watered/beered and educated without anything appearing to go wrong (except when the hotel bar ran out of beer &#8211; I blame <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/">Steve Marshall</a>). I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://clearleft.com">clearlefties</a> and <a href="http://www.glennjones.net/Home/">Glenn</a> and everyone from Madgex. Good job everyone involved.</p>

    <p>More interesting Newcastle centric news, although this time partly releveant to everyone else &#8211; well, as long as you live in Oxford, Brighton, Leeds or Manchester that this.</p>
<p><a href="http://notes.natbat.net/">Natalie Downe</a> has spent some of her copious spare time (having left the agency way of life and gone all <a href="http://notes.natbat.net/2007/08/19/freelance/">freelance</a> too) cooking up <a href="http://geekvenues.com/">Geekvenues</a>. It&#8217;s an attempt to map (using Google Maps) any and all geek related venues around the UK. Local meetup places perhaps, regular venues, or just geek friendly pubs with wifi.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been adding some venues for Newcastle and they can be found over at <a href="http://newcastle.geekvenues.com/">newcastle.geekvenues.com/</a>. If anyone knows of any other ones let me know. And if anyone is thinking &#8220;I want it to cover my neck of the woods&#8221; then get in touch with Nat, ideally with a link to a <span class="caps">KML</span> file of locations. I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://www.azcazandco.com">Alan</a> and <a href="http://sneeu.com/blog/">John</a> from Edinburgh in particular here.</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2007</span>

    <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpenCoffee.png" title="Open Coffee" alt="Open Coffee" /></p>
<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is a new, open, informal and regular meetup for technology entrepreneurs, designers, bloggers, developers, geeks, investors and anyone else whoâ€™s interested.</p>
<p>We are going to meet every Thursday morning, between 10am and 12pm, at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the+side+cafe+newcastle">The Side</a> just off Newcaste Quayside.</p>
<p>The first event will be held on September 13th. So come and share ideas, demo, get to know each other or just have a coffee.</p>
<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is part of the global community effort over at <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org">opencoffeeclub.org</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html">the blog post that started it all</a></p>
<p>With all that out of the way a little bit of background and some geekier links. I&#8217;d been meaning to get an OpenCoffee event up and running for a while and after a couple of chats in nice pubs with <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam</a> and a trip to The Side we had a date and a vague plan. Worst case is it&#8217;s me and Sam just meeting up but hopefully a few more people will make it along. We should have wireless as well for any demos.</p>
<p>Note I&#8217;ll likely be somewhat wired. I might be up in edinburgh the night before for <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/"><span class="caps">FOWA</span> roadtrip</a> and in any case I&#8217;ll have been up all night at <a href="http://www.barcampbrighton.org/">barcampbrighton</a>.</p>
<p>You can register for the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/254890/">event on upcoming</a> or even register for <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3537/">the group</a>. Or you could just turn up. See you there! Any questions post a comment (either here on on upcoming) or drop me an email.</p>
