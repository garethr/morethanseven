        Logging Django Performance
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Jun 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been doing some basic performance profiling work with Ruby on Rails recently and one tool I found very useful was the <a href="https://github.com/wvanbergen/request-log-analyzer">request log analyzer</a>. It&#8217;s a relatively simple command line application that you can point at the Rails application log files and it outputs lots of information in agregate. So information about request duration averages or about <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries run. When working on a recent Django project I wanted a tool to do the same thing and ended up writing timelog.</p>
<p>I did a bit of research to see if I could find something similar. Here are a few other interesting tools that didn&#8217;t quite do what I wanted:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/jmoiron/django-slow-log">Django Slow Log</a> &#8211; This logs things like memory and load averages</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/lamby/django-dumpslow">Django Dump Slow</a> &#8211; Similar but designed to just log slow requests rather than everything, also needs a Redis backend</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/jbalogh/zamboni/blob/master/apps/amo/middleware.py#L162">Zamboni Middleware</a> &#8211; This is very similar to what I wanted, but it&#8217;s not a separate module and I didn&#8217;t find anything to analyse the results</li>
</ul>
<p>Timelog is very similar to the middleware in Zamboni, the only real difference being I&#8217;m using the new logging support in Django 1.3. More interesting is the bundled management command which will output something like:</p>
<pre>

+--------------------------+--------+--------+-------+---------+---------+-------+-----------------+
</pre>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;ve not done any real benchmarking or optimisation of the script, but it will chew through a 300,000 line (20MB) log file in under 20s on my aging macbook.</p>
<p>The code for Timelog is on github at <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-timelog">github.com/garethr/django-timelog</a> and I&#8217;ve uploaded to PyPi as well at <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-timelog">pypi.com/django-timelog</a>. You can install it with the usual tools like pip:</p>
<pre>pip install django-timelog</pre>
<p>Once installed you need to do a little configuration to get things working. First add the middleware to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES in your settings file.</p>
<pre>
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
  'timelog.middleware.TimeLogMiddleware',
</pre>
<p>Next add timelog to your INSTALLED_APPS list. This is purely for the management command discovery.</p>
<pre>
INSTALLED_APPS = (
  'timelog',
</pre>
<p>Then configure the logger you want to use. This really depends on what you want to do, the django 1.3 logging setup is pretty powerful. Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;ve got logging setup as an example:</p>
<pre>
TIMELOG_LOG = '/path/to/logs/timelog.log'

LOGGING = {
  'version': 1,
  'formatters': {
    'plain': {
      'format': '%(asctime)s %(message)s'},
    },
  'handlers': {
    'timelog': {
      'level': 'DEBUG',
      'class': 'logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler',
      'filename': TIMELOG_LOG,
      'maxBytes': 1024 * 1024 * 5,  # 5 MB
      'backupCount': 5,
      'formatter': 'plain',
    },
  },
  'loggers': {
    'timelog.middleware': {
      'handlers': ['timelog'],
      'level': 'DEBUG',
      'propogate': False,
     }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>In order for the analyser script to work correctly you&#8217;ll need to use the plain formatter and to register a handler for the timelog.middleware logger.</p>
<p>With that all configured try hitting your application a few times. You should see a log file created at the location specified in TIMELOG_LOG. Fill that up with a few lines and then run the analyze_timelog management command:</p>
<pre>python manage.py analyze_timelog</pre>
<p>This should output something similar to the above table but with your timings and views. The management command currently allows you to point the analyzer at a different file say from a backup, or a file you&#8217;ve pulled down from production but want to run the command locally. I&#8217;ll likely add some filters as time permits for things like not showing all views or showing only views between a given date range.</p>
<p>The above table showing the view function is good for big picture trends, but if you want to dig down into a particular path then you can pass an argument to not reverse the path:</p>
<pre>python manage.py analyze_timelog --noreverse</pre>
<p>This should give you something more like:</p>
<pre>

        Debugging HTTP Headers with RedBot
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jun 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es">Vagrantbox.es</a> site as a bit of a playground recently and I&#8217;ve been meaning to blog about some of the overengineering I&#8217;ve been doing. Here&#8217;s a smaller starter.</p>
<p>Getting the headers returned by your web server correct is both easy to do and easy to forget about. Unless you go actively looking for headers with curl or similar you&#8217;ll probably miss them, and even then will you spot an incorrect header by eye? <a href="http://redbot.org">RedBot</a> is an excellent online tool that not only shows you the headers but makes recommendations about what might be missing, invalid or things you haven&#8217;t considered.</p>
<p>For instance the <a href="http://redbot.org/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vagrantbox.es">RedBot results for vagrantbox.es</a> look like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjJ4gEM" alt="Debugging information from Redbot"/></p>
<p>Or at least they do now after a few tweaks to my nginx configuration. In particular I&#8217;ve added</p>
<pre>add_header Vary Accept-Encoding;</pre>
<p>I&#8217;d assumed that enabling gzip compression with gzip_vary would have set this automatically and never checked. The way RedBot provides a checklist of recommendations is very handy.</p>
<p>As well as checking the page itself you can also check all the assets associated with a page by adding a query string argument. For instance here is the <a href="http://redbot.org/?descend=True&amp;uri=http://www.vagrantbox.es">assets view for Vagrantbox.es</a>. RedBot also provides a <a href="http://redbot.org/?id=o5GXZe&amp;descend=True&amp;format=har"><span class="caps">JSON</span> encoded version of the result</a> which might be useful in a CI system. If you&#8217;d rather run your own instance of the software you can, the code can be found on github at <a href="http://mnot.github.com/redbot/">mnot.github.com/redbot/</a>. It currently doesn&#8217;t work with <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> resources but that&#8217;s about the only thing I&#8217;d like to see added.</p>

        Python On Cloudfoundry
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 May 2011</span>

    <p>For those that haven&#8217;t yet had a look <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/">Cloudfoundry</a> from VMware is two things, one of which is nice, one of which is very cool indeed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>On one hand it&#8217;s a platform as a service, allowing you to easily deploy Ruby, Java and Node.js applications to <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/">cloudfoundry.com</a>.</li>
	<li>On the other hand it&#8217;s an <a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/">open source project</a> with all the code on <a href="http://github.com/cloudfoundry">Github</a> allowing you to run the entire stack wherever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty interested in the latter. Its <span class="caps">API</span> could in theory become a defacto standard for application and service buildouts, in the same way as we&#8217;re seeing the EC2 <span class="caps">API</span> expand outside <span class="caps">AWS</span> for managing infrastructure (and arguably how we&#8217;re using Chef and Puppet for managing the things installed on that infrastructure). The really interesting bit is the fact it&#8217;s all open source. Not only does that mean you can run it on your own infrastructure (including as I&#8217;m doing on a virtual machine on my laptop), but it&#8217;s also designed so new services (like Redis, MySQL, RabbitMQ), new runtimes (like Ruby 1.8, RUby 1.9, Java) and new frameworks (like Rails, Sinatra, Spring) can be added easily.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m running vcap on a <a href="http://vagrantup.com">vagrant</a> managed VirtualBox instance, but you could install it anywhere you like. I used <a href="https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart">these chef recipes</a> to get everything installed. I ran into an issue with the mysql service not starting correctly that <a href="https://github.com/auser/cloudfoundry-quickstart/pull/2">I fixed</a> and I needed to manually install chef into the rvm gemset part way through the install, but the recipes pretty much just worked.</p>
<p>Looking for an excuse to have a route through the vcap code I decided to see if I could add rudimentary support for Python applications. After a day of noodling around I&#8217;ve forked the code and sent a few pull requests back with it basically working. This required changes to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vmc/pull/18">vmc client</a>, to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/pull/57">vcap service</a> and like all good open source contributions to the <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-tests/pull/4">test suite</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks hugely to existing pull requests (mainly the one&#8217;s for <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap/pull/25">adding <span class="caps">PHP</span> support</a>) it&#8217;s not taken long at all. The Sinatra and Rails support which shipped with the first release from VMWare supports using Bundler to define gem dependencies that can be pulled in at deploy time. It shouldn&#8217;t be too much effort I&#8217;m hoping to do the same for using pip and virtualenv for each deployed python application. I think I can also see how to support python3 and how to add django as a supported framework.</p>
<p>I had huge fun, but you might not at this early stage in the project. I&#8217;m relatively happy with reading and writing Ruby, futzing with rvm, debugging installation woes and hunting down service configuration problems. The best tool for working out what was happening was generally tailing the logs in /tmp/vcap-run/ and finding the code that wrote a given message. If you just want something to work I&#8217;d wait a little while, if you like the sound of the above it&#8217;s a pretty nice codebase to play around in. I&#8217;d love to eventually see some official contributor documentation and some hints and tips on things like running the tests. At the moment flicking through reported issues and pull requests on GitHub is the best place to start.</p>

        Vagrant Plugin For Interacting With Vagrantbox.es

    <span class="post-date">08 May 2011</span>

    <p>After <a href="http://www.jedi.be/blog">Patrick</a> released <a href="https://github.com/jedi4ever/sahara/">Sahara</a>, a nifty extension for the <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> command line tool, I&#8217;ve been meaning to put together a similar extension for interacting with the growing list of base boxes on <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es">vagrantbox.es</a>.</p>
<p>After a bit of hacking this morning I&#8217;ve just pushed out an initial release of the <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrantboxes">vagrantboxes gem</a> and you can find the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/ruby-vagrantboxes">source code and some documentation on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The extensions adds a vagrantboxes namespace to the vagrant command line tool which provides a few useful commands. Specifically you can list all the available boxes, do text searches, show the full details of a box and most handily of all add a box that takes your fancy to your local base box store, all without having to worry about the URLs of the boxes if you don&#8217;t want to.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a simple search:</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; vagrant vagrantboxes search centos
3    centos 5.5                http://dl.dropbox.com/u/15307300/vagrant-0.7-centos-64-base.box
6    opscode centos 5          http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/centos5-gems.box
7    opscode ubuntu 10.04      http://opscode-vagrant-boxes.s3.amazonaws.com/ubuntu10.04-gems.box
9    puppet centos 5.5 64      http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos5_64.box
10   puppet centos 4 64        http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/centos4_64.box
21   centos 5.6 32             http://yum.mnxsolutions.com/vagrant/centos_56_32.box</pre>
<p>And another quick example, this time of show printing the full description. In the future I might look to store more structured metadata and make this more useful.</p>
<pre>&gt;&gt; vagrant vagrantboxes show 18
puppet debian lenny 64
http://puppetlabs.s3.amazonaws.com/pub/debian_lenny_64.box

Debian Lucid 64 bit vagrant box. Puppet 2.6.6 installed and ready to provision using the Puppet provisioner in Vagrant.

For good sample modules, try the jeffmccune-motd and jeffmccune-mockbuild modules posted to http://forge.puppetlabs.com/

Created by Ken Barber, ken@puppetlabs.com</pre>
<p>This proved a good excuse to delve into the Vagrant source code which is pretty readable for the most part once you understand the libraries it&#8217;s build upon. It&#8217;s simple enough to extend for adding commands like this too, which bodes well for other more useful additions in the future.</p>
<p>If anyone has any problems with this extensions do let me know. Error handling currently consists of returning blank output rather than sensible error codes or messages, and as I&#8217;ve yet to add a small test suite so their might (will) be a few bugs lying around. I&#8217;ll try and make it better behaved in the next week or two but reasoned it&#8217;s useful straight away.</p>

      <a href="/2011/05/07/Version-control-and-deployment-of-cron-jobs/">
        Version Control And Deployment Of Cron Jobs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 May 2011</span>

    <p>A recent question on Twitter prompted me to write a quick blog post about managing cron jobs. As more and more people want to automate provisioning and deployment of web applications some, maybe previously manually managed, items come into the fold.</p>
<p>Cron jobs are interesting because you may prefer to see them as part of the infrastructure (like apache or mysql) or as part of your application code. I think both are valid, sometimes at the same time. For instance you might have a cron job which deals with scheduled database backups. All that requires is the database and the script to be present. At other times your cron jobs might require your entire application stack. For instance a rake task which uses a Rails application model, or a django management command.</p>
<h2>Configuration Management and Cron</h2>
<p>Both <a href="http://opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/">Puppet</a> provide a cron resource type. This is particularly handy for things like database backup scripts or ganglia gmetric scripts. You probably want these scripts and cron jobs to be installed on machines that have the related software installed, and you&#8217;re probably already describing this in your Chef recipes or Puppet manifests. If you&#8217;re not already using one of these tools using them to manage just your cron jobs is a nice way of starting out.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://docs.puppetlabs.com/references/latest/type.html#cron">Puppet Cron Type</a> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>cron { command:
  command =&gt; "/usr/local/sbin/command",
  hour =&gt; 2,
  minute =&gt; 0
}</code></pre>
<p>And the equivalent <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Resources#Resources-Cron">Chef Reasource</a> looks like:</p>
<pre><code>cron "describe your job" do
  hour "2"
  minute "0"
  command "/usr/local/sbin/command"
end</code></pre>
<p>The important part is that by describing your cron jobs in code you can then version control them easily, and both Chef and Puppet have mechanisms to push these jobs out to be installed by the relevant hosts. With cron jobs you might not want all your machines to be running the same jobs for instance.</p>
<h2>Using Whenever</h2>
<p>An alternative, or complimentary, approach to versioning and deploying cron jobs would be to tie it in with your application code. This makes sense when those jobs are tightly coupled to your application, for instance rails specific rake tasks or django management commands. <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever</a> is a tool I&#8217;ve been using recently that makes this pretty simple. You describe your cron jobs in a file called schedule.rb like so:</p>
<pre><code>every 3.hours do
  command "/usr/local/sbin/command"
end</code></pre>
<p>And then running the provided whenever command line application will generate a working crontab. Whenever ships with capistrano integration and some useful shortcuts for running rake tasks or accessing Ruby code, but it&#8217;s simple to write your own command shortcuts without having to write ruby code too.</p>
<h2>Other Approaches</h2>
<p>I have seen some tools which replace cron completely, but I&#8217;ve never liked that idea much. Cron works pretty well, and is clever enough to deal with things like daylight saving time and leap years inteligently if needed. I know other folks who are centralising all regular jobs into something like Jenkins. I can see advantages to that, although I&#8217;ve yet to find a really nice way of automating this outside the gui interface or manually modifying configuration files.</p>
