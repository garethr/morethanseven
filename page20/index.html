        Speaking at DIBI

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2010</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ll be heading back up to Newcastle in April to give a talk at what&#8217;s shaping up to be a good looking conference to kick off the year with. <a href="http://www.whatisdibi.com/"><span class="caps">DIBI</span></a> is trying to please everyone, with both front and backend focused streams.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Created for both sides of the web coin, <span class="caps">DIBI</span> brings together designers and developers for an unusual two-track web conference. World renowned speakers leading in their fields of work will talk about all things web. Taking place in Newcastle upon Tyne, (it&#8217;s oop north) at The Sage Gateshead on the 28th April 2010, we&#8217;re bringing both sides of the web world together with some awesome speakers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of making a point of dividing frontend and backend work. You nearly always end up with javascript dominated horribleness (because we only had a front end person available) or a so called content management system that means all sites have to look the same except for the colour palette. So I&#8217;m hoping lots of cross over stuff happens and interesting conversations abound.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you&#8217;re wondering what I&#8217;ll be speaking about it&#8217;s probably going to be something about all the cool tools you could and should be using when building or looking after web applications. I&#8217;ll probably be doing my best to convince people to look outside the comfort of the <span class="caps">LAMP</span> or C#/<span class="caps">MSSQL</span> stacks and realise the future for lots of web developers might just be more devops.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just found <a href="http://github.com/samuel/dreque">Dreque</a> from <a href="http://samuelks.com/">Samuel Stauffer</a> on GitHub. It&#8217;s yet another take on the whole messaging things which is definitely seeing a lot of activity at the back end of this year. It&#8217;s using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> on the backend and looks really rather nice:</p>
<p>Submitting jobs:</p>
<pre><code>from dreque import Dreque
def some_job(argument):
    pass
dreque = Dreque("127.0.0.1")
dreque.enqueue("queue", some_job, argument="foo")</code></pre>
<p>Worker:</p>
<pre><code>from dreque import DrequeWorker
worker = DrequeWorker(["queue"], "127.0.0.1")
worker.work()</code></pre>

        Erlang Screencasts
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to learn Erlang for a while. What I actually mean is it&#8217;s been on my list of <em>things to learn</em> for months, along with all sorts of other incredibly interesting bits and pieces. I spend a little bit of time at home but the majority of my learning time is now spent commuting to London and back most days. Sometimes I&#8217;m even going all the way to Swindon which gives me even longer to not learn Erlang.</p>
<p>The main problem with learning something new on the train is space. Reading a book (or my new Kindle) or just using my laptop is fine. Trying to do both at once is nearly impossible (I&#8217;ve tried). So I&#8217;ve decided to give another approach a try, namely screencasts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve only done the first <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">Erlang in Practice</a> episode so far but I was hugely impressed with the content and general presentation. $5 as well doesn&#8217;t seem bad at all I don&#8217;t think. The episode was half an hour long, but took me a little longer, probably closer to 45 minutes, as I was playing along at home and typing the code examples as I went. I also got sidetracked with messing with my vim configuration at the same time but hey. This makes them perfect for my hour long commute. The full series is 8 episodes long and with luck I&#8217;ll be able to work through them this week.</p>
<p>So, good job <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/">Kevin Smith</a> and <a href="http://www.pragprog.com">Pragmatic</a> for a nice, accessible start to Erlang. All I need to do now is find something interesting to hack on in Erlang.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been lurking on the django-developers mailing list for the last couple of weeks and that provided an excuse to play with the <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2009/09/soon-to-launch-lists.html">new Twitter Lists</a> feature. So here&#8217;s a <a href="http://twitter.com/garethr/djangocommitters">list of djangocommitters on twitter</a>. If I missed someone do let me know. Their is a chance you won&#8217;t be able to see this if you&#8217;re not on the beta yet I think, sorry!</p>
