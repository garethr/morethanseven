    <p>It&#8217;s taken longer than I would have liked but I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to relaunching this site on <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>.</p>
<p>After looking through lots of code from the <a href="http://projects.stoneship.org/trac/nanoc/wiki/Showcase">nanoc showcase</a> I had a pretty good feel for how I wanted things to work and I then used the excellent <a href="http://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog">nanoc3_blog</a> template to get started. I&#8217;ve hacked around quite a bit with the code to get things how I wanted them. Using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> to make the <span class="caps">CSS</span> more manageable, <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">Coderay</a> for lovely syntax highlighting and making everything default to textile rather than markdown. I&#8217;ve also written import scripts for my old blog (in Python) and another one so I can use tumblr is I want to create items on here (in Ruby).</p>
<p>Nanoc really is a joy to work with and I&#8217;m hoping that alone will get me back into writing more freqently than I have done for a while. The fact I can just write in Vim or WriteRoom or whatever editor I have to hand feels nice. And using Git, Rake and Rsync complete my little toolset. Everything is still served via Nginx.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thrown the all the code, including all the content, up on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/morethanseven">GitHub</a> for anyone interested. Back to writing.</p>

        Mysql Support For Cucumber Nagios
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>I just noticed Lindsay had <a href="http://github.com/auxesis/cucumber-nagios">committed</a> the amqp steps for cucumber-nagios and remembered I hadn&#8217;t mentioned on here some other work I&#8217;ve been doing on the same project. We use MySQL quite a bit at work and I&#8217;ve been wanting to extent our monitoring for a while. So I set about thinking how that would work with cucumber-nagios. What I&#8217;ve come up with looks something like this:</p>
<pre>
Feature: localhost
  To make sure the rest of the system is in order
  Our database server should not be overloaded

  Scenario: check running processes count
    Given I have a MySQL server on localhost
    And I use the username root
    Then it should have less than 10 processes

  Scenario: check queries per second
    Given I have a MySQL server on localhost
    And I use the username root
    Then it should have less than 200 select queries per second
    Then it should have less than 300 queries per second
    Then it should have less than 5 slow queries pers second
    Then it should have at least 10 queries per second
</pre>
<p>The numbers, username details and host details are all variables. So you can write senarios for your specific deployments. The tests over time are based on a very short lived sampling mechanic which I&#8217;ve yet to test in anger. I&#8217;m not sure just yet is this approach will lead to too many false positives but we&#8217;ll have to see.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://codeinthehole.com/archives/8-Monitoring-MySQL-with-Ganglia-and-gmetric.html">mysql gmetric script</a> gave me lots of the ideas for invidual steps. I&#8217;ll be writing more about some work I&#8217;ve been doing with cucumber-nagios and ganglia soon as well.</p>
<p>For the moment if anyone want&#8217;s to try these steps out you can either check out <a href="http://github.com/garethr/cucumber-nagios">my cucumber-nagios</a> fork or just grab the steps from the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/cucumber-nagios/blob/master/lib/generators/project/features/steps/mysql_steps.rb">mysql_steps.rb</a> file. Any feedback much appreciated.</p>

    <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2010</span>

    <p>Every now and again I feel the need for a change and spent a little time tonight looking at different blogging software. I&#8217;m currently running a custom django app I wrote a good while ago, more as an excuse to play with Django than anything. Previously I&#8217;ve used Wordpress, Textpattern and even Radiant. But I&#8217;m coming to the conclusion that what I want doesn&#8217;t exist. In theory that means an opportunity for someone to enter the market, in reality I think it might just be me. So, what do I want?</p>
<ul>
	<li>Customisable <span class="caps">URL</span> patterns and redirects. Tumblr did well until this point but I have years of content on nice URLs and I&#8217;d not going to throw that away.</li>
	<li>Command line interface for posting snippets</li>
	<li>Nice looking web based <span class="caps">API</span> (bonus points to Typepad here for some nifty features like pubsubhubhub)</li>
	<li>iPod touch app</li>
	<li>Real control over the design, not just pre-made templates unless you pay for a pro account</li>
	<li>Hackable (this could mean anything, but I know it when I see it. So not WordPress then.)</li>
	<li>Export plain text out</li>
	<li>Use my own domain name</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a sneaking suspicion what I might be thinking about is a private tumblr blog used as a datasource for <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc3</a>. But that relies on me having the time to build that as I can&#8217;t find anyone who might have written such a think. Maybe one day.</p>

        The rise of the in-house team?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2010</span>

    <p>I was just thinking about the <a href="http://www.dibiconference.com/">Design it Build it</a> conference later in the year (full disclosure: I&#8217;m speaking). Specifically the people speaking on the developer track. Between myself, Michael Brunton-Spall from The Guardian, David Singleton from Last.fm and Emma Persky from Gumtree four of the six speakers work on in-house teams. Not early stage start-ups, not large software/advertising companies, not as freelancers but in a reasonable sized company on a development team.</p>
<p>My original background was working in agencies, and then a stint working for myself and I&#8217;m constantly interested by the different facets of the web software industry. I think conferences or magazines aimed at your average interested web developer or designer play an interesting role in what people perceive as normal. If all you see are people who work as a freelancer you start to think that must be way cooler than whatever it is you&#8217;re doing at the time. I remember attending the first @media event and being surprised at the small number of people from larger agencies. Everyone was from smaller boutique places, or Yahoo! or a freelancer. Now lots of people I see at events are involved in startups.</p>
<p>Interestingly as well none of it is about a particular language or framework. Thinking about it as I type I think between the four of us we spend are day jobs mainly using different languages (java, python, php, perl). But I bet we all work in environments where we use other languages at least occasionally, or at the least the people around us do. Mixed environments are commonplace in companies that have been around a good while and run on software. They are far less common elsewhere with startups using whatever is cool (lets build a mobile search engine in Haskel anyone?) and small agencies often using whatever they built their first client website with (probably <span class="caps">PHP</span>).</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m really interested in though is the type of topics that are going to be talked about. Last.fm vs the Xbox, Scaling the Guardian, my rambling thoughts on a modern toolbox for developers beyond your average <span class="caps">LAMP</span> or .<span class="caps">NET</span> stack. This is the sort of think I&#8217;m interested in. It&#8217;s the sort of problems I like having. It&#8217;s also, I think, the sort of stuff that doesn&#8217;t get a showing a many mainstream conferences. I&#8217;m hoping it&#8217;s all going to be fairly practical too &#8211; things that whatever role people have they can take away and apply.</p>
