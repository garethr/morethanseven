        More Django Project Templates

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>Quite a while ago I released some handy scripts for building up Django project layouts. Part of the reason behind this was to kick off discussions about ideal pproject layouts and maybe even get a few user submitted layouts into the project. Paster makes this soft of thing really easy to do and I was interested in what people might come up with.</p>
<p>Well, the team over at <a href="http://chicagotribune.com/">The Chicargo Tribune</a> have done just that, creating a branch of the original project and <a href="http://github.com/ryanmark/django-project-templates/">adding a very rich example project to it</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to merging that back into <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-project-templates/">my branch</a> and releasing a new version to <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-project-templates/0.11">PyPi</a>. It&#8217;s got a good number of PostGreSQL commands that might be of use, as well as several Amazon S3 and EC2 examples. Even if none of these complete templates fit what you&#8217;re looking for exactly their are lots of smaller fabric recipes worth taking a look at.</p>
<p>You can read all about what is in the project over on their <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/03/08/advanced-django-project-layout/">developer blog</a>, which if filled with other interesting web and operations goodness.</p>
<p>So, huge thanks to <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/author/cgroskopf/">Chris</a>, <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/author/bboyer/">Brian</a>, <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/author/ryanthomasmark/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/author/joegermuskact/">Joe</a> for some great work.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of virtualenv for Python. It&#8217;s a simple tool that lets you have an isolated python environment into which you can install libraries via setup tools. It makes experimenting with different versions of code easier and avoids lots of problems with hard to find bugs caused by unknown third party conflicts.</p>
<p><a href="http://github.com/nkryptic/sandbox">Sandbox</a> aims to do exactly the same for Ruby. It isolates your gem installation from the system libraries and providesa script to activate the named environment. The GitHub repo has been around since 2008, yet only has 37 followers. I&#8217;m not sure whether that is because another more popular and feature rich solution exists or because Ruby people haven&#8217;t yet found this technique useful. For me finding tools that work the same way as those I already like in other languages makes me happy.</p>

        Static Generator For Web Services
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Mar 2010</span>

    <p>My latest <em>on a train</em> project is <a href="http://github.com/garethr/Dumper">Dumper</a>, a static generator for web services. I&#8217;m a huge fan of <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">Nanoc</a> and tools like <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyl">Jekyl</a> for building websites. But I spend at least as much time building small webservicds. I wanted something super simple that would let me expose data I had access to as a read only web service.</p>
<p>At the moment that means using a mysql database, specifying a <span class="caps">SQL</span> query and running a python script. Hey presto you have lots and lots of <span class="caps">XML</span> and <span class="caps">JSON</span> files representing your data. Dumper provides hooks for you to customise the ourput or even overide the database layer. It should be possible if you were so inclined to replace the mysql backend with another database, or other type of data store. Hopefully some of these might end up in my branch at a later date.</p>
<p>At a basic level all you need is a config file which looks a little like:</p>
<% syntax_colorize :ini, type=:coderay do %>
[Dumper]
path: people
index: id
backend: mysql

[Database]
sql: SELECT id, name FROM people
host: localhost
username: root
password:
database: dumper
<% end %>
<p>And then run a command line application against that file:</p>
<% syntax_colorize :bash, type=:coderay do %>
dumper -c people.ini dump
<% end %>
<p>The application supports a number of flags for specifying where you want the files to be generated, what your config file is called and to clean up any generated files if you want to try again. The output will let you know which files have been updated, which deleted and which added too. If you&#8217;d rather have a single file but with all your records in then that&#8217;s easy too &#8211; just add something to the config file.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s somewhat early days for Dumper, and I&#8217;ve not seen anything similar so their are definately some rough edges that could do with some work. All of that will really come down to how much use it gets. I&#8217;d appreciate any feedback from anyone with a similar itch to scratch too.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston">Piston</a>, the django app for creating RESTful web services. As part of a project at work I ended up looking through the source code, mainly at some of the neat tricks of serialisation of objects. While poking around I came across something in my mind that wanted fixing. This being open source rather than just file a bug report I setup a <a href="http://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> account and got hacking.</p>
<% syntax_colorize :python, type=:coderay do %>
def render(self, request):
	cb = request.GET.get('callback')
        seria = simplejson.dumps(self.construct(),
		cls=DateTimeAwareJSONEncoder,
		ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)

        # Callback
        if cb:
            return '%s(%s)' % (cb, seria)

        return seria
<% end %>
<p>Can you spot the problem? Note the use of the callback passed in the query string arguments and then used <em>without any checking</em> in the output.</p>
<p>What we really want to do is something like this:</p>
<% syntax_colorize :python, type=:coderay do %>
if is_valid_jsonp_callback_value(cb):
<% end %>
<p>Which is exactly what has just <a href="http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/changeset/f558b2c66dcc/">gone into the code for Piston</a>. <a href="http://tav.espians.com/sanitising-jsonp-callback-identifiers-for-security.html">This article</a> contains lots of background information about why <span class="caps">JSONP</span> callbacks can be a security hole, and helpfully provides a <a href="http://github.com/tav/scripts/blob/master/validate_jsonp.py">nice Python module</a> to help with the sanitisation. Nice to be on the authors list for something I&#8217;m using actively.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/jespern">Jesper Noehr</a> for Piston, for some pointers on bitbucket and for quickly taking the patch. If you&#8217;re accepting a callback on your site or application, especially if it&#8217;s a public service, you really want to do something like this or you just might have an exploitable security hole.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s taken longer than I would have liked but I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to relaunching this site on <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org/">nanoc</a>.</p>
<p>After looking through lots of code from the <a href="http://projects.stoneship.org/trac/nanoc/wiki/Showcase">nanoc showcase</a> I had a pretty good feel for how I wanted things to work and I then used the excellent <a href="http://github.com/mgutz/nanoc3_blog">nanoc3_blog</a> template to get started. I&#8217;ve hacked around quite a bit with the code to get things how I wanted them. Using <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> to make the <span class="caps">CSS</span> more manageable, <a href="http://coderay.rubychan.de/">Coderay</a> for lovely syntax highlighting and making everything default to textile rather than markdown. I&#8217;ve also written import scripts for my old blog (in Python) and another one so I can use tumblr is I want to create items on here (in Ruby).</p>
<p>Nanoc really is a joy to work with and I&#8217;m hoping that alone will get me back into writing more freqently than I have done for a while. The fact I can just write in Vim or WriteRoom or whatever editor I have to hand feels nice. And using Git, Rake and Rsync complete my little toolset. Everything is still served via Nginx.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thrown the all the code, including all the content, up on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/morethanseven">GitHub</a> for anyone interested. Back to writing.</p>
