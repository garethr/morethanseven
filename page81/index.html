    <p>Sorry for the title. As a few people already know I&#8217;m moving jobs at the end of the month to Th_nk. Basically to do more web design with the emphasis on <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and the like.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m not going to go on about it as I&#8217;m trying to stick to issues on here about web stuff rather than about me but thought it worth a post.</p>

    <p>Wow. I&#8217;m still pretty wired after two days of conference and several late nights but boy was it worth the effort and more.</p>
 <p>First I just want to say a big thanks to Patrick (<a href="http://www.htmldog.com">htmldog.com</a>) for organising the event and to all the speakers and attendees I spoke to.</p>
 <p>I must mention Molly Holzschlag (<a href="http://www.molly.com">www.molly.com</a>) individually for being amazing thought. Thanks for the beer.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get something more useful up here with more salient points over the next couple of weeks but for the moment I just want to say it was an inspirational couple of days, and make sure to watch the blogs of the speakers for real indepth stuff (rather than just awe).</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve of late been playing around with a number of different ways of storing bookmarks after realising I was just not bothering before. I added del.icio.us links to the site a bit ago and I&#8217;ve just come across Scuttle (<a href="http://scuttle.org">scuttle.org</a>) which is a <span class="caps">GPL</span> <span class="caps">PHP</span> del.icio.us clone which is really quite nice.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve set it up at the moment on one of my machines and might look to add a styled and modified version to this site as time and inclination allow.</p>

    <p>After much going backwards and forwards I finally sat down and had a protracted play with Ruby on Rails and so far I have to say I&#8217;m impressed.</p>
 <p>Installation was simple enought and I got it running on both mac and linux hardware pretty easily, always a bonus, and I have vim set up to play with ERuby syntax.</p>
 <p>I had dabbled previously with Ruby and coming from <span class="caps">PHP</span> the syntax is fairly self explanatory (remember end not }).But ActiveRecord in particular seems just great.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m going through the Four days on Rails tutorials at the moment so should have something more insightful to say in a week or so (I dont actually have four days in a row to just do this really).</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m in the process of setting up the site so I can post from my Palm Tungsten T5. The image appearing here, of the device in question, will appear now for any posts I make from it when I&#8217;m out and about. How often this will be is anyones guess but I&#8217;m heading to @media in London soon so maybe some updates from there?</p>
