        Easy for whom? - a minor rant about help from frameworks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>Some people think that <a href="http://www.lscheffer.com/malbolge.shtml">programming should be hard</a> while others, like me, quite like the idea of anyone being able to build things, especially web sites. To me the fact that either of my housemates (non IT types) could probably build a website this evening if they so choose is great. And to be honest if they did I&#8217;d be unlikely to complain about the code or the programme they chose to build it with (Ok, I would, but that&#8217;s me and I&#8217;d like to pretend I wouldn&#8217;t.)</p>
 <p>It&#8217;s pretty unlikely however that either of them, or any beginnner, would go along the route of choosing say <a href="http://asp.net"><span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span></a> or <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> for that first site. Which leads me to some sort of assumption &#8211; <em>that both of these</em> are for experts and <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/14/web-standards-and-the-new-professionalism/">professionals</a>. There are other facets which could be used to back up this argument but I dont want to go on &#8211; rails making use of the command line (in very cool ways) or <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> requiring <span class="caps">IIS</span> configuration for a start. Not something I fancy talking non experts through to be fair.</p>
 <p>Using that assumption brings me nicely to helpers. Both are frameworks that try (and in may places succeed) in making life easier for developers. This is a good thing. What&#8217;s not so good is where this goes too far, in my opinion. <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfsystemwebuiwebcontrolslinkbuttonclasstopic.asp">linkButtons</a> are simply Evil. No questions. At All. Stop using them. Now. Rails wades in as well with it&#8217;s reliance, when it comes to certain controls, on inline Javascript. Did someone not get the <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">memo</a>?</p>
 <p>As good web standards people we have divided content from presentation. Behaviour from both (sort of). Now we have great (in both senses of the word) frameworks coming along and riding roughshod over our labour of love to make the web a better place. Making the developers life easier, but impacting negatively on the end users. Such wide ranging and powerful tools for experts need not treat all users as experts in everything. <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> (or Ruby on Rails) does it so it must be OK? cannot be allowed to undo good works.</p>
 <p>Lots of similar talk abounds at the moment, with certainly some light in some of these areas showing through. Visit <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/bollocks/2006/02/09/rails-is-the-devil-in-your-client-side-shoulder">Dan</a> and <a href="http://domscripting.com/blog/display/49">Jeremy</a> for more.</p>

        One Conference Down

    <span class="post-date">09 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>Well, yesterday was the long awaited <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> which seemed to go pretty well all in all. Lots of <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1087/">reviews</a> and <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">notes</a> around at the moment but I&#8217;ll just throw a couple of my personal observations into the mix.</p>
 <p>The presentation where all good, but nothing mindblowing. Most had something going for them; whether <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">enthusiasm</a>, <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com">numbers</a> or a <a href="http://feedburner.com">special announcement</a></p>
 <p>I liked <a href="http://plasticbag.org">Tom Coates</a> diatribe about clean URLs, it something I&#8217;m fairly keen on too, I&#8217;m uming and arring over whether I too am a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/redux/97126279/"><span class="caps">URL</span> Fetishist</a></p>
 <p>The <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> vs <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> show was entertaining and interesting. Reading that Google tend to be more academic with Yahoo being a little bit more unhinged/entreprenurial is one thing &#8211; going to a conference where the guy from Google came across as something of a mad german professor with something of an <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=javascript">axe</a> to grind, compared to the Yahoo mob who ranged from a <a href="http://plasticbag.org">self confessed hippy</a> to <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal</a> and his three quarter length trousers. It&#8217;s appears all the rumours are true.</p>
 <p>I did a couple of stints of SubEthaEdit collaborative note taking with <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/02/08/summit">Simon</a> which was fun and interesting at the same time. The <em>who&#8217;s going to write the next part</em> bit was quite amusing &#8211; at times writing the same things down, then everyone deleting them, then a pause.</p>
 <p>The after show was, as always, good fun and fairly drunken. The pub was nice, but whomever suggested it on the wiki was playing a cruel joke. A conference with 800 geeks and a pub about 3 people wide at it&#8217;s widest point is not sensible. Neither was <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick&#8217;s</a> suggestion about not eating, but it all worked out in the end.</p>
 <p>Was good to meet up with lots of people, both those <a href="http://htmldog.com">I</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">had</a> <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/">met</a> <a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">before</a> and those that <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">I hadn&#8217;t</a>. Hope to see everyone again soon, if not it will have to be <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>.</p>

    <p>Not so subtle hint in the subject line, but without further ado, Molly (yes, that <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a>) is coming to Newcastle for a talk.</p>
 <p>All the details are still being confirmed but we are talking:</p>
 <p><strong>15th February</strong><br />
Room 149 Northumberland Building, Northumbria University, City Campus, Newcastle, NE1 8ST<br />
<strong>5-7pm</strong></p>
 <p>After talk drinks and food to be confirmed. Probably going to be along the lines of &#8220;Webstandards and Usability&#8221; with some time for a Q&#38;A session as well.</p>
 <p>Big up to <a href="http://tomsimcox.com">Tom Simcox</a> here. He&#8217;s been threatening for a while and with Molly in the country she&#8217;s agreed to come and visit little old us. Mark (of sunderland uni and <span class="caps">NEUA</span> fame) also sorted out the venue, amongst other things. Good job everyone.</p>
 <p>We need people along for this so tell you employers, whoop to your colleagues, threaten you employees and be there.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll post more details as they are confirmed. If your from outside the region and want to come along let me know. It&#8217;s short notice but sometimes these things are &#8211; and you know you dont want to miss out.</p>
 <p>To help us gauge interest a little it would be grate if you interested  to leave a comment below. If you cant come along because say, <a href="http://xlab.co.uk">it&#8217;s your birthday</a>, then what questions would you like asking?</p>

    <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>Of late I&#8217;ve found myself making quite a few smaller purchases of software. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Open Source (and before that shareware &#8211; mainly on the ZX Spectrum) and still use lots of open source apps (anyone say Firefox) but for some really specific jobs it&#8217;s nice to have something you know is maybe a little more polished.</p>
 <p>I dont know if it&#8217;s just me getting older and having more disposable income, or a greater appreciation of what it takes to make really good software (probably a bit of both) but it&#8217;s sort of snuck up on me? Anyone else finding the same? I know <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a> has been mentioning some <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/happy-old-man">cool new apps</a> he&#8217;s using. What about everyone else?</p>
 <p>Recent purchase have included the following, nearly all bought with <a href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> as it happens:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a> allows any sounds (mainly music) to be send round the house to speakers connected to my AirPort. Lovely.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/pspware">PSPWare</a> Like iSync but for my <span class="caps">PSP</span>. Also converts movies.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/">radioShark</a> Ok, software and hardware but useful at times.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a> I&#8217;ve mentioned before. Lovely stats.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I&#8217;m also evaluating (and at the moment being impressed by) a few other apps. Upcoming purchases probably.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/quick_news/">QuickNews</a> <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader (and podcasting app) for Palm OS.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">PocketTunes</a> Good quality audio player for Palm OS, much better than the bundled Real Audio.</li>
  <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> The missing editor for OS X? Maybe. It&#8217;s toying with me at the moment to sit aside <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>On a blog related point, I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;ve been blogging more technology related stuff of late. I&#8217;ll be back with alot more web design and development banter soon, and some things happening up this neck of the woods (including a revamped <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia</a> site hopefully) &#8211; it&#8217;s a matter of having the ideas but not having the time! Hope it&#8217;s still all interesting to everyone.</p>

        The Meaning of  Scale
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m quite a <em>numbers</em> person and have something of a penchant for statistics  As if you couldn&#8217;t guess from the site name. So it is with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> (who also have a mathematical inspired site name). But unlike me they have more people (it&#8217;s just me) and lets face it, more computing power (only so many computers I can get in my house without getting told off).</p>
 <p>So they bring us something of a <a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html">large, automated, study</a> (including some decent analysis) of what markup is <em>actually</em> being used, interestingly also including common class names. I&#8217;d love to do something like that &#8211; over 1,000,000,000 sites analysed!</p>
 <p>On a standards front seems to be good news and bad news, some of the common classes are things like:</p>
<ul>
 <li>footer  </li>
  <li>menu </li>
  <li>title, header, top </li>
  <li>small, smalltext </li>
  <li>text, content, main, body </li>
  <li>nav </li>
  <li>copyright </li>
  <li>search </li>
  <li>date</li>
</ul>
 <p>Most of those I can see use for. They <strong>Mean</strong> something for a start. Although some of the other top entries included things such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>white</li>
  <li>link</li>
  <li><del>button</del></li>
  <li>style1 (my personal fave)</li>
</ul>
 <p>Which maybe aren&#8217;t as well chosen.</p>
 <p>On the other hand there are still lots of weirdness, proprietary   tags and bizarre attributes. iWeb might be using crazy nested divs but <a href="http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2006/01/26/iweb-is-not-evil">it&#8217;s still valid</a>.</p>
 <p>Being Google it&#8217;s all written fairly amusingly, including a few digs at competitors with applications which generate nightmare markup. Overall, a good read. There are probably a good number of other useful nuggets of information burried in the document as well. Anyone coming across anything of particular relevance leave a comment.</p>
