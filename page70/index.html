    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>More of a statement of intend, for posterity&#8217;s sake hopefully. Something I can look back on and think &#8220;Oh, yeah, I meant to do that&#8221; later in the year. Also so I dont forget, or just decide I couldn&#8217;t be bothered. Why this all of a sudden? Well, it&#8217;s the start of the new year anyway, but in particular the first meetup of people from the <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> list got me thinking. And in particular more than thinking, wanting to act on existing thoughts.</p>
 <p>So, without further ado, here is a brief list of thinks I&#8217;m going to do this year &#8211; fingers crossed, in no partricular order and missing several things that no one reading this will care about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Get as much out of the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Future of Web Apps Summit</a> as possible. I&#8217;m pretty interested in the <em>design</em> of applications at the moment.</li>
  <li>Not still have a hangover for the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/services/training/ajax.php">Ajax training session</a> with <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> two days after the summit.</li>
  <li>Get an article written and published in something I read.</li>
  <li>Package up the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">feed syndicator</a> code base under a decent name and release it for anyone to use.</li>
  <li>Produce a real application using <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.</li>
  <li>Somehow get to all four (or is it five, I can&#8217;t remember) of the <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006"><code>media&lt;/a&gt; themed nights out &amp;#8211; as well as as many of the workshops and presentations one personn can get to without &lt;a href="http://www.muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/01/5/</code>media2006.php&quot;&gt;cloning</a></li>
  <li>On the back of our first real local meetup get a few projects moving. Everyone put email addresses to faces, which I think was important, and should make getting together doing something active easier from now on.</li>
  <li>And finally something vague; (note that this isn&#8217;t me with an idea under wraps, this is as far as I&#8217;ve got!) Design and build something <em>of use</em> to the wider web community.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I may have forgetten a couple of things, I&#8217;ll add them as I see fit. Anyone else got a list that they would like to share? Either on here or post a link to your own site.</p>

        Widgets
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>Of late I&#8217;ve got round to installing a few widgets on my computers &#8211; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard">Dashboard</a> on my Mac and <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com">Yahoo Widgets</a> on Windows (no linux widgets as yet). I&#8217;m actually still running OS X 10.3.9 and using the very nice <a href="http://www.mesadynamics.com/amnesty.htm">Amnesty</a> to allow run to Mac Widgets.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to play with widgets for a while, mainly because I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript for years and widgets simply reuse these technologies &#8211; making it easy to just jump in an make something handy. I&#8217;m also a fan of web services in general and  widgets provide another handy interface to many online services.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve mainly been using the <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Junior Mint</a> widget (and <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=37576">Minty</a>) for keeping an eye on my site stats, I think I mentioned before I&#8217;m hooked). I&#8217;ve also been using WiFi monitoring widgets, battery monitoring widgets and looking at the <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> <a href="http://www.chipt.com/">widget</a> which looks nice.</p>
 <p>As for having a go at developing them &#8211; I just made available my first go, a widget to keep track of the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">@media2006 feed agregator</a> I have built. It&#8217;s relatively simply &#8211; it polls the site for a couple of variables and displays them across a couple of panes. The numbers in question are the total number of posts, the number of new posts this week and today &#8211; as well as a countdown to the event. I had to do a little work to expose these properties in an <span class="caps">XML</span> format from the site but nothing major.</p>
 <p>I learned by looking at a couple of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/index.html">tutorials</a> as well as existing widgets. Disecting code prooved the most useful &#8211; the majority of tutorials seemed to provide good <em>Hello World</em> examples but you could probably guess most of that. If anyone has any good intermediary or advanced widget tutorials then let me know.</p>
 <p>The main problem with the development process was definately the iterative testing. With web pages I tend to work in large steps (with very little testing) early on and then move to more small changes and quick testing later on when it&#8217;s down to the details rather than the brush strokes. I&#8217;d definately echo the sentiment of others by testing in safari (it uses the same rendering engine) first, and also add that getting all the markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span> in place before moving to Javascript is probably the best bet. You really need to test the Javascipt with a real running widget as it has it&#8217;s own functions available via the widget object. I&#8217;ve heard Apple may be working on a suitable <span class="caps">IDE</span> for widgets (my guess would be a tie in with Xcode) and I&#8217;ve come across <a href="http://www.widgetfactor.com/factor.php">Wcode</a> which appears to offer some useful tools.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve not yet looked into the situation with Yahoo Widgets &#8211; I intend to port my @media widget to Yahoo as an experiment and we&#8217;ll see how that goes (and yes I know that&#8217;s the wrong way round &#8211; Dashboard was, to some, a copy of Konfabulator, now Yahoo widgets. It&#8217;s early days I think for widgets &#8211; the move to more of a distributed systems feel, with open APIs and web services, amongst modern web applications would seem to be a perfect match for small desktop applications that tie into them. Watch this space.</p>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>Yes it&#8217;s back. <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> returns as promised by <a href="http://htmldog.com">Patrick</a> last year and, well, it&#8217;s definately bigger. Two streams, more speakers and panels than you can shake a pink elephant at. I know for a fact that this was being planned even before <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> had left the bar last year and boy does it show.</p>
 <p>The blogs are alight with the sound of people coming up with something, anything to tell their bosses in the morning. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one still awake either posting comments (Yes <a href="http://zachinglis.com">Zach</a>, <a href="http://spintered.co.uk">Patrick</a> I do mean you) and making blog posts.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll post more about what I want to see, how I&#8217;m going to decide which sessions to go to (I&#8217;ll need some sort of system &#8211; simply trying to decide which one&#8217;s will be best will only end in heartbreak) over the next 6 months or so. Yes it really is that far away. With the <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson Summit</a> coming up so soon as well that should more than keep me going &#8211; especially with them having different emphasise (web standards/accessibility and web application development/design respectively) to keep thinks from getting boring.</p>
 <p>And with all that in mind the reason it&#8217;s late when I post this makes sense. Yes it&#8217;s <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">another</a> <a href="http://morethanseven.net/dconstruct">feed</a> <a href="http://morethanseven.net/carson">agregator</a> thing.</p>
 <p><a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">morethanseven.net/atmedia2006</a></p>
 <p>The place is already starting to hot up and I&#8217;d guess that will only get worse (or better?) over the next few days. I&#8217;m glad to get in early this time. Last year proved useful (at least to me) in keeping up with the aftershow goings on with 150 posts from 52 feeds &#8211; but  I only got it together a week or so after the event, thanks mainly to <a href="http://kurafire.net">Faruk</a> for compiling the initial list of posts.</p>
 <p>Any bugs or suggestions let me know. Also if anyone has a good name (feed agregator is pretty mechanical) then please do tell. I&#8217;ve added a few of the requested features from previous editions and it&#8217;s now possible to quickly suggest new feeds and to search through all the posts.</p>
 <p>Anyway &#8211; Hope to see people in June. My predictions of a year of real world activity to mirror our enlightened online existence are coming to fruitition already.</p>

        @Commented-on Follow up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>Since the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/commented-on">brief discussion</a> based around <a href="http://www.ben-ward.co.uk">ben&#8217;s</a> original idea for using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> to track comments you have made on other blogs I&#8217;ve been having a play.</p>
 <p>The main issue that people saw was simplicity, which I see falling under two headings:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Ideally it should just happen. If you comment somewhere (and opt in, obviously) you browser or online service should keep a track and give you access to this data. This would require changes to existing blogs and in particular the common software like <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">textpattern</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org">the other one</a></li>
  <li>Saving that for later, a simple one click service which does not get in the way and achieves the same thing should be suitable.</li>
</ul>
 <p>It&#8217;s the later that I&#8217;ve been playing with and thought I&#8217;d present here in it&#8217;s early stages. The plan is as follows:</p>
<ul>
 <li>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> collects the data from the page (title and url) and sends it to an intermediary page, rather than del.icio.us.</li>
  <li>The intermediary page prompts for a username and password (<span class="caps">HTTP</span> authentication) and adds the post to del.icio.us automatically.</li>
  <li>The page is then either closed or redirected back to the page from whence the request came.</li>
</ul>
 <h3>The bookmarklet</h3>
 <p>The bookmarklet section is simple enought modifications of the existing del.icio.us bookmarklets. See the download at the end of this post for details.</p>
 <h3>Intermediary</h3>
 <p>The intermediary page uses <span class="caps">HTTP</span> authentication to ask for a del.icio.us username and password (note that I&#8217;m not storing these at all, or for that matter at present checking if they are correct.) This needs only happen the first time you use the page if you use your browser to store the details or once per browser session otherwise.</p>
 <p>The page then makes a request to the <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/api/">del.icio.us <span class="caps">API</span></a> using the lovely <span class="caps">PHP</span> library from <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/delicious/">dietrich.ganx4.com/delicious/</a></p>
 <h3>Return</h3>
 <p>On a failed request the page reports that an error has occured (I&#8217;ll expand on this with more pertinent error messages as time permits.)</p>
 <p>On success however we have two options, depending on the bookmarklet used. The default is to close the page down, with an alternative beiong to redirect back to the refering page. We do however run into a slight problem here with Firefox. Our favourite browser will only allow windows to be closed via javascript if they where opening by a script (<span class="caps">NOT</span> including our bookmarket). Internet Explorer has a similar set up where it prompts the user for an action, although a <a href="http://www.guyfromchennai.com/?p=18">simple fudge</a> get&#8217;s us around that one. At the moment therefore the close window bookmarklet is of limited usage for Firefox users.</p>
 <h3>Future</h3>
 <p>This could quite easily be expanded for use on a blog as the requests are simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests with query string parameters. However the security implications of giving out your username and password would likely limit this approach. I&#8217;m going to look into the sending of bookmarks to others that ben mentioned and see if that can be used here &#8211; as hopefully that may only require you to give out your username. A service like <a href="http://www.gravatar.com/">gravatar</a> could then be used to do lookups between email addresses and del.icio.us usernames and away we go.</p>
 <p>Any thoughts, comments or suggestions welcome. And feel free to try out the bookmarklets. I&#8217;ve included a handy download below including a quick readme and the bookmarklets.</p>

        Obligatory next year post

    <span class="post-date">27 Dec 2005</span>

    <p>Well, that&#8217;s nearly 2005 over and done with. Quite an eventful year all told and I couldn&#8217;t let it end without the obligatory <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/12/web_design_and_development_trends_for_2006/">next</a> <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/come-with-me-on-a-journey">year</a> <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/12/13/mollys-unabashedly-biased-picks-2005-blogs-design-books-and-achievements/">post</a> .</p>
 <p>So without further ado, this year various things happened to me:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.atmedia2005.co.uk">@media</a> was great. Met <a href="http://mrpatto.com/">lots</a> of <a href="http://www.molly.com/">nice</a> <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">people</a> and had a blast. Roll on next year.</li>
  <li>I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/thnking-about-a-move">moved jobs</a></li>
  <li>I actually started blogging. I redesigned the site around that goal and now I&#8217;m hooked. Oh well.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com">Reboot</a> was a massive success. It got me to redo my site properly, got me all of ten minutes of minor fame and I&#8217;m still on the front page. Thanks to everyone.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Next year my crystal ball predicts:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit/index.html">Carson Workshops Summit</a> will be huge.</li>
  <li>I&#8217;ll find something more specific to write about rather than jumping around all the time.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> will kick into action with some real world meetups and then who knows?</li>
</ul>
 <p>On less of a self centred trip:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.nwpropertysolutions.com">Elastic</a> and <a href="http://www.cssliquid.com">Liquid</a> design will be essential.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/yahoo_vs_google_an_academics_vs_inthetrenches_entrepreneurs_showdown_.php">Yahoo Vs Google</a> will really hot up. With more buying and innovating that you can shake a stick at.</li>
  <li>Intel powered Apples will be launch to a crazy ipod fueled public. Who still wont buy them. They will however by the machine of choice for the discerning conference attending web design geek next year.</li>
  <li>Some crazy, web 2.0, buzzword compliant <span class="caps">CMS</span>/Blogging software will hit the streets causing a ruckus. Textpattern will still be great.</li>
  <li>Some cools stuff has to come out of <a href="http://pages.alexa.com/prod_serv/WebInfoService.html">Alexa opening up their archive via web services</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>All in all, I&#8217;m looking forward to next year for a range of reasons including the above. Hope to see (or meet) all of you (again) over the coming year.</p>
