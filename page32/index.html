        HTTP Debugging Server in Django
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been busy building and playing with various <span class="caps">HTTP</span> clients recently, mainly due to more playing with RESTful web services. I took a couple of hours out to build something to make my life easier &#8211; namely a very simple <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/tree/master">logging <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server in Django</a>.</p>
<p>All the application does is accepts <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests and log the results to a file. I&#8217;ve been using it to make sure the requests I&#8217;m sending from elsewhere are correct, before pointing the client at a web service that actually does something useful. It supports <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span>, <span class="caps">DELETE</span>, etc. So far so simple.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjSDww" alt="screenshot showing us tailing the logs"/></p>
<p>I ended up using Django mainly because I did most of the work on the train, and I know my way around it pretty well by now. I did originally thing it might have been better to use something simpler but I did end up learning a few new tricks that I&#8217;ll use for future projects.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In theory <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1807">Django doesn&#8217;t need a database</a>. While this is true for the most part, the in-built test runner does require a database. One thing I&#8217;ve talked about before is the usefulness of creating your own custom test runner. If anyone else runs into this specific problem have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/nodatabase.py">nodatabase.py</a> file.</li>
	<li>The logging is handled via Python&#8217;s inbuilt logging module. It has some nifty features (like log rotation, maximum file sizes and different logging levels) but is a little fiddly to get working correctly. Tales abound of log messages appearing multiple times, or permission errors causing problems. At least for this project I think I have everything working. I&#8217;ll try using this <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/log.py">module</a> on a couple of other projects and maybe spin it off into a small reusable app.</li>
</ul>
<p>For something that took only a few hours to write it was both good fun and a useful learning tool. And Django proved itself more useful that I though for smaller services like this.</p>

    <p>It turns out the guys at GitHub publish the <a href="http://github.com/changelog">commit messages from their work on GitHub</a> itself. If you really have to keep up you can even subscribe to an <a href="http://github.com/changelog.atom">Atom feed</a>.</p>
<p>OK, so this might not be hugely useful. But it <em>is</em> funny, and a just a nice sign of a small company being open in an interesting way. A few of my favourites:</p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I quite like <a href="http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/">Epydoc</a> for generating Python <span class="caps">API</span> documentation, even if the interface looks a little dated and could do with a lick of paint.</p>
<p>For most project I use an Ant build script to generate documentation when needed. You could wrap the basic commands in a make file or a bash script if you prefer that sort of thing though. The only trick is to make sure you have everything you need on your Python Path. In Django projects, or App Engine projects, you&#8217;ll probably find the default runner script plays with the path somewhat. The following example adds the current directory to the path along with an ext directory where I stash external modules, which should see it run cleanly without any import errors.</p>
<pre>&lt;project name="secretproject" default="create-api"&gt;
    &lt;property name="name" value="secretproject"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="parent" value="/www/projects"/&gt;
    &lt;property name="api" value="/www/project/secretproject/api"/&gt;
    &lt;target name="create-api" description="Generate API documentation with epydoc"&gt;
         &lt;exec executable="/bin/sh"&gt;
             &lt;env key="PYTHONPATH" value="${parent}:${parent}/${name}/ext:$PYTHONPATH"/&gt;
             &lt;env key="DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE" value="${name}.settings"/&gt;
             &lt;arg line="-c 'epydoc --html -o ${api} --name ${name} --graph all ${name}'"/&gt;
         &lt;/exec&gt;
    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;</pre>

        Example of using XMPP on App Engine (via IMified)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>As I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/02/07/xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-engi/">mentioned before</a>, App Engine is getting an <span class="caps">XMPP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> at some point soon. But if you just can&#8217;t wait to start adding IM interfaces to your applications then you <em>can</em> do it now, by using a nifty third party in <a href="http://imified.com/">IMified</a>.</p>
<p>IMified provide an incredibly simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> for interacting with your own IM bot. If we want to be buzz word compliant we might even call it a <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com">webhook</a>. It&#8217;s also currently a free service while they work through the beta. The <a href="http://new.imified.com/developers/api">documentation</a> is short and to the point but only contains examples in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It supports multiple step <em>conversations</em> as well as authentication.</p>
<p>So, armed with a little time on the train over the last few days I got to work knocking together a quick demo application as a proof of concept. You can find the site on <a href="http://imified-demo.appspot.com/">imified-demo.appspot.com</a> and if you want to chat with the bot you can add <em>appengineimified@bot.im</em> to your contacts. The bot uses the Jabber protocol so is available over Jabber or GTalk. IMified make it easy to use <span class="caps">MSN</span> or Yahoo IM accounts as well, which is something the App Engine <span class="caps">API</span> might very well not do I would imagine.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjRDww" alt="Screengrab of the IMified App Engine site"/></p>
<p>As always you can find the code on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-imified/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Most of the code is actually just the site itself or settings to make local development easier. The following is a slightly edited version of the live code (logging and caching removed to make it easier to follow). All we need to do is accept a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Post request with a list of arguments and return a plain text response. All being well the response is sent as a IM message to the sender.</p>
<pre>class IMified(webapp.RequestHandler):
    "This is the endpoint for the message from IMified"
    def post(self):
        "We recieve post data from IMified"
        userkey = self.request.get('userkey')
        network = self.request.get('network')
        msg = self.request.get('msg')
        step = self.request.get('step')
        try:
            # we try and create the message
            message = Message(
                userkey = userkey,
                network = network,
                msg = msg,
                step = int(step)
            )   
            message.put()
            # the response is send as an IM message to the sender
            self.response.out.write('Message saved')
        except:
            self.response.out.write('An error ocured, message not saved')</pre>
<p>IMified can obviously be used outside App Engine as well, and in fact it&#8217;s not just about working around limitations in existing systems. Running the long running processes required for bots, and potentially even running your own <span class="caps">XMPP</span> server, is fiddly at times and requires at least some setup, monitoring and configuration to get working. Not having that as a barrier for entry for simple experiments or applications is a good thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral</a> spoke at the last <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-london"><span class="caps">DJUGL</span></a> about App Engine and mentioned a wide range of third party services that you can use to get around current limitations. IMified definitely fits into this group of support services very nicely indeed. I&#8217;d love to see them do really well as it really makes it much easier to get started with <span class="caps">XMPP</span> applications, even if what you can do is limited to a few simple APIs. I&#8217;d love to hear about other services that people are using in this way to build these distributed applications.</p>

        Python REST Client
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m working on a small project involving using RESTful APIs and wanted a simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> client, something that sat a little higher in the stack than <a href="http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/">httplib2</a> or similar. I turned initially to the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/models/test_client/">Django Test Client</a> which now <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/">supports all the required methods</a> but it turned out that I&#8217;d have to unpick it from django a little.</p>
<p>With a little bit of looking around I found the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-rest-client/">python-rest-client</a> which certainly sounded like it would do what I wanted. It lets you make <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests in as straight forward a manner as possible and fitted the bill perfectly.</p>
<pre>from restful_lib import Connection
conn = Connection("http://morethanseven.net")
response = conn.request_get("/")</pre>
<p>It supports authentication, nice helper methods and gives you the response in a nice format.</p>
<pre>conn = Connection("http://example.org", username="XXX", password="XXX")
conn.request_delete('/items/11232344')</pre>
<p>As an added benefit it also comes with a Google App Engine compatible version.</p>
