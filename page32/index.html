    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2009</span>

    <p>I gave a short presentation about App Engine last night at the <a href="http://campug.org.uk/">Cambridge Python User Group</a> and as always it&#8217;s available on <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a>.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>I find App Engine a great way of just writing (Python) code and putting it online quickly, and the presentation was aimed at being something of a fanboy ode. During questions afterwards we talked about some of the limitations and cases where App Engine isn&#8217;t as well suited, and at least a few people were heading off planning on having a play.</p>
<p>The event was good fun and I picked up a few Python related tips and tricks from the other presentations and general conversation. Thanks for everyone who organised and attended the event and to <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC</a> for hosting the talks.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve finally been getting round to doing a bit of work on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/">dmigrations</a>, the Python based database migration tool we developed at <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dmigrations offers a simple but flexible way of managing changes to the database in your Django projects. It is a replacement for Django&#8217;s built in syncdb command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still have some work to do to merge in a number of modifications we&#8217;ve been running internally for a while but I&#8217;ve triaged the issues list that had been left alone for too long and merged in a fantastic collection of patches from a few people including Alexander Robbins and <a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/">Chris Lamb</a>. Thanks hugely to everyone for these.</p>
<p>Everything is available in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/source/browse/#svn/trunk">trunk in <span class="caps">SVN</span></a> at the moment ahead of me cleaning a few thinks up and updating the download version. I&#8217;ve added a setup.py file as well ahead of hopefully adding it to the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a>.</p>
<p>I obviously wasn&#8217;t the only one who had decided to do some work on the project in the last couple of days. <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/users/msaelices/">msaelices</a> has just submitted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/issues/detail?id=21">a patch</a> which adds a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> backend. I don&#8217;t tend to use PostgreSQL personally so if anyone does want to have a look at running dmigrations with the patch I&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>

        Startup Hubs in the UK - Where To Put One?

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I always enjoy reading things by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, even if I&#8217;d like to be able to disagree with his conclusions on occasion. It&#8217;s not just that I love <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, but also he often says things like the following that make me smile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen&#8217;s agreements than regulations. If they shake your hand on a promise, they&#8217;ll keep it. But show them a lock and their first thought is how to pick it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest short essay concerns <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/maybe.html">startup hubs</a> again, something that I&#8217;m actually pretty interested in, end up talking to <a href="http://imranali.name/">people</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/herbkim">about</a>, but hardly ever writing anything on. Mike over at Techcrunch Uk elicited some good comments last year with a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/starting-the-campaign-for-the-techhub/">post on the subject</a>. As usual Graham focuses on the US, but what about translating his idea of buying a Startup Hub and applying it to the UK? He sets several criteria for success:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have good weather?</li>
	<li>Do people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?</li>
	<li>Would the city be described as &#8220;hip&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; or as reflecting &#8220;traditional values?&#8221;</li>
	<li>Are there good universities nearby? Are there walkable neighborhoods?</li>
	<li>Would nerds feel at home?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets assume for the moment that the idea would work. Take £15-20million and invest in 30 or so well chosen startups on the condition they move into town. The question is then: <strong>where in the UK would this be most likely to work? And are their any UK specific criteria that would increase the success rate?</strong></p>
<p>Some people might be thinking &#8220;but no UK city is going to invest £20million in a scheme to encourage startups&#8221;. Leeds is <a href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/business-news/Universities-bid-to-help-.4979184.jp">doing just that</a>. Or rather Yorkshire Forward are putting up £35million along with Leeds University putting up £31milion. What are they doing with all that money? They are going to build a big building with it &#8211; which is exactly what Graham says won&#8217;t work.</p>

        HTTP Debugging Server in Django
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been busy building and playing with various <span class="caps">HTTP</span> clients recently, mainly due to more playing with RESTful web services. I took a couple of hours out to build something to make my life easier &#8211; namely a very simple <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/tree/master">logging <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server in Django</a>.</p>
<p>All the application does is accepts <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests and log the results to a file. I&#8217;ve been using it to make sure the requests I&#8217;m sending from elsewhere are correct, before pointing the client at a web service that actually does something useful. It supports <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span>, <span class="caps">DELETE</span>, etc. So far so simple.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjSDww" alt="screenshot showing us tailing the logs"/></p>
<p>I ended up using Django mainly because I did most of the work on the train, and I know my way around it pretty well by now. I did originally thing it might have been better to use something simpler but I did end up learning a few new tricks that I&#8217;ll use for future projects.</p>
<ul>
	<li>In theory <a href="http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/1807">Django doesn&#8217;t need a database</a>. While this is true for the most part, the in-built test runner does require a database. One thing I&#8217;ve talked about before is the usefulness of creating your own custom test runner. If anyone else runs into this specific problem have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/nodatabase.py">nodatabase.py</a> file.</li>
	<li>The logging is handled via Python&#8217;s inbuilt logging module. It has some nifty features (like log rotation, maximum file sizes and different logging levels) but is a little fiddly to get working correctly. Tales abound of log messages appearing multiple times, or permission errors causing problems. At least for this project I think I have everything working. I&#8217;ll try using this <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-http-debug/blob/0ef82784abfc70cc63444e39f61807675acd5c29/http_debug/lib/log.py">module</a> on a couple of other projects and maybe spin it off into a small reusable app.</li>
</ul>
<p>For something that took only a few hours to write it was both good fun and a useful learning tool. And Django proved itself more useful that I though for smaller services like this.</p>

    <p>It turns out the guys at GitHub publish the <a href="http://github.com/changelog">commit messages from their work on GitHub</a> itself. If you really have to keep up you can even subscribe to an <a href="http://github.com/changelog.atom">Atom feed</a>.</p>
<p>OK, so this might not be hugely useful. But it <em>is</em> funny, and a just a nice sign of a small company being open in an interesting way. A few of my favourites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mmm pizza&#8230; guard against bad SHAs in Walker#commit</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>really need to get a handle on this insane testing setup</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess ff3 linux is the worst browser ever made</p>
