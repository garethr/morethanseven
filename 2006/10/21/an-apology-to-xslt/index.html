  <h1 class="post-title">An apology to XSLT</h1>
  <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2006</span>
  <p>I have to admit to thinking that <span class="caps">XSL</span> was something of a waste of time a while back. I&#8217;ve changed my mine and wanted to muse about why.</p>
 <p><span class="caps">XML</span> is simple enough to jump right in, and a few years back it had a big enough band wagon to mean jumping on was pretty much required. I think in hindsight, at least in my mind, alot of this was just a little gratuitous. <span class="caps">XML</span> abstraction layers, <span class="caps">XML</span> content management systems, <span class="caps">SOAP</span>, etc.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;d often seen <span class="caps">XSLT</span> as the template layer in an <span class="caps">XML</span> based content management system and after several looks went back to using light weight systems that made sense. The idea of going from a database to <span class="caps">XML</span> then outputting <span class="caps">HTML</span> via <span class="caps">XSLT</span> just made me wonder why. The rationale that you could then output it as anything (<span class="caps">WML</span>, <span class="caps">PDF</span>, whatever) was very nice, but rarely actually realised from what I saw, and easy enough to do with any half decent templating system. You also always seemed to need more <span class="caps">XSLT</span> that it looked like you should.</p>
 <p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> even wore as a badge of honor that it didn&#8217;t need to do any <span class="caps">XML</span> pushups to deal with configuration. And even those with a penchant for Java seem to have problems with using <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/printArticle/column-20060901-05.html"><span class="caps">XML</span> as a programming language</a>.</p>
 <p>Of late though I&#8217;ve been back playing with APIs, many of which produce <span class="caps">XML</span> in one way or another (whether that&#8217;s <span class="caps">RSS</span>, Atom or some custom format), and <span class="caps">XSL</span> actually comes in pretty handy here for just thowing around content. I did some work with a <a href="http://mini.google.co.uk">Google Mini</a> too using <span class="caps">XSLT</span> and their are some <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">interesting tricks</a> with <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> to boot. I haven&#8217;t listened to the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/wsg/audio/index.xml">podcast</a> yet so I&#8217;m just guessing at the moment but I could see <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">Drew&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Your website as your <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221; talk at the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/10/21/following-the-wsg-microformats-event/">recent <span class="caps">WSG</span> meeting</a> making use of <span class="caps">XSLT</span>?</p>
 <p>So, I think I might have changed my mind a bit. <span class="caps">XSL</span>, I think, is going to be a useful skill to have in your toolkit in a world of microformats and APIs. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/">W3Schools <span class="caps">XSL</span> tutorial</a> is a pretty good starting place if you&#8217;ve not used it previously at all. Thought I&#8217;d still rather use a <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">decent templating engine</a> for site rendering tasks.</p>
