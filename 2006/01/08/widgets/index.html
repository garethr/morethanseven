  <h1 class="post-title">Widgets</h1>
  <span class="post-date">08 Jan 2006</span>
  <p>Of late I&#8217;ve got round to installing a few widgets on my computers &#8211; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard">Dashboard</a> on my Mac and <a href="http://widgets.yahoo.com">Yahoo Widgets</a> on Windows (no linux widgets as yet). I&#8217;m actually still running OS X 10.3.9 and using the very nice <a href="http://www.mesadynamics.com/amnesty.htm">Amnesty</a> to allow run to Mac Widgets.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to play with widgets for a while, mainly because I&#8217;ve been using <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript for years and widgets simply reuse these technologies &#8211; making it easy to just jump in an make something handy. I&#8217;m also a fan of web services in general and  widgets provide another handy interface to many online services.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve mainly been using the <a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Junior Mint</a> widget (and <a href="http://www.widgetgallery.com/view.php?widget=37576">Minty</a>) for keeping an eye on my site stats, I think I mentioned before I&#8217;m hooked). I&#8217;ve also been using WiFi monitoring widgets, battery monitoring widgets and looking at the <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> <a href="http://www.chipt.com/">widget</a> which looks nice.</p>
 <p>As for having a go at developing them &#8211; I just made available my first go, a widget to keep track of the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">@media2006 feed agregator</a> I have built. It&#8217;s relatively simply &#8211; it polls the site for a couple of variables and displays them across a couple of panes. The numbers in question are the total number of posts, the number of new posts this week and today &#8211; as well as a countdown to the event. I had to do a little work to expose these properties in an <span class="caps">XML</span> format from the site but nothing major.</p>
 <p>I learned by looking at a couple of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Dashboard_Tutorial/index.html">tutorials</a> as well as existing widgets. Disecting code prooved the most useful &#8211; the majority of tutorials seemed to provide good <em>Hello World</em> examples but you could probably guess most of that. If anyone has any good intermediary or advanced widget tutorials then let me know.</p>
 <p>The main problem with the development process was definately the iterative testing. With web pages I tend to work in large steps (with very little testing) early on and then move to more small changes and quick testing later on when it&#8217;s down to the details rather than the brush strokes. I&#8217;d definately echo the sentiment of others by testing in safari (it uses the same rendering engine) first, and also add that getting all the markup and <span class="caps">CSS</span> in place before moving to Javascript is probably the best bet. You really need to test the Javascipt with a real running widget as it has it&#8217;s own functions available via the widget object. I&#8217;ve heard Apple may be working on a suitable <span class="caps">IDE</span> for widgets (my guess would be a tie in with Xcode) and I&#8217;ve come across <a href="http://www.widgetfactor.com/factor.php">Wcode</a> which appears to offer some useful tools.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve not yet looked into the situation with Yahoo Widgets &#8211; I intend to port my @media widget to Yahoo as an experiment and we&#8217;ll see how that goes (and yes I know that&#8217;s the wrong way round &#8211; Dashboard was, to some, a copy of Konfabulator, now Yahoo widgets. It&#8217;s early days I think for widgets &#8211; the move to more of a distributed systems feel, with open APIs and web services, amongst modern web applications would seem to be a perfect match for small desktop applications that tie into them. Watch this space.</p>
