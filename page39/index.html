    <p>A short break from blogging ends with a new site design. As with all these things their will no doubt be a few kinks still to work out and I&#8217;ll be adding to the design a little over the coming months. The main reason for all this change? A move to a custom <span class="caps">CMS</span> build using Django. This was something of an excuse to play around with Django outside <a href="http://www.gcapmedia.com/">work</a> and I&#8217;m pretty happy with the results. I have all the bits of wordpress I actually used, plus a few bits I didn&#8217;t have before. More importantly I have something I want to hack on. Wordpress is a kick ass blogging tool, but keeping it updated or adding new features never seemed much like fun.</p>
<p>It seems like it&#8217;s the week for Django related site launches in the UK. We released the <a href="http://www.capitalradio.co.uk/">new Capital Radio site</a> on the world last week and Nat beat me by a day or so with <a href="http://natbat.net/">her new Django powered site</a>. Look for more in the future too I would wager.</p>
<p>I have a whole range of posts brewing about what I found out along the way, both building a personal blog and building a large site with a big team. Keeping up with the bleeding edge of Django ahead of the 1.0 release took some doing (I&#8217;m running the latest Trunk release here at the moment). Deciding to use a combination of <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning/0.7">Spawning</a> and <a href="http://nginx.net/">Nginx</a> for serving is a nice break from Apache as well. But that is all for later when I have a little more time.</p>

        Of Hacking, Continuous Integration and Django

    <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve not written anything here for a good few weeks, my tweeting has slowed down some and I&#8217;m behind on my feed reading. I&#8217;m going to blame the new job and the daily commute from Cambridge to London I think. I&#8217;ve definitely not been any less busy that usual:</p>
<h3>Hacking</h3>
<p>We had an internal hackday on Thursday and Friday last week where lots of us over at GCap/Global downed tools and build cools stuff for a couple of days. This is exactly the sort of reason I took the job in London &#8211; for the opportunity to build interesting things quickly with other smart people. I got to play around with an event driven, music orientated, <span class="caps">API</span> hack and a more useful but less sexy documentation hack. Yes, I said documentation hack. I might be able to release the latter all being well but I need to finish it off first and kick the tyres on some internal projects</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>As a development team we&#8217;re using <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for everything which is proving to be huge fun. It&#8217;s a decent size project and we&#8217;re pushing Django (and in particular new-forms admin) in interesting ways. Having worked previously with <span class="caps">PHP</span>, <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> and Rails I&#8217;m loving lots of bits of Django. I mentioned the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/why-the-webstandards-world-appears-to-be-choosing-django/">template system</a> before but their are lots of other things to appreciate. Some of this just comes from working with people like <a href="http://simonwillison.com">Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.siudesign.co.uk/">Rob</a> who know Django pretty well. Some of it just from being able to write Python every day.</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>When not working on Django, or writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> or Javascipt (now mainly using <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>), I&#8217;ve been busy pushing the benefits of Continuous Integration. As someone who is actually pretty bad at writing unit tests I like the process of working with <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">Cruise Control</a> as a gatekeeper. I also like automation in general so have been busy with Ant scripts and some Twill scripts as well for more functional testing. Django&#8217;s test suite is pretty nifty and easy to use. <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/testing/">The official documentation</a> is a pretty good starting point but I&#8217;m still on the lookout for some more in depth best practices articles.</p>
<p>So, between writing lots of code I&#8217;ve had less time to write words other than internal documentation. I&#8217;m finding the change pretty refreshing at the moment but want to keep up with writing every now and again. Who knows how that will work out? I have a feeling that I might blog more geeky code related stuff but time will see how that plays out.</p>

        Where are the Rock Star Web Project Managers?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>In maybe a more constructive manner than <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/media-designers-vs-developers/">yesterday</a> I started wondering where the rock star web project managers hang out? I think we&#8217;re all aware of something of a celebrity culture within web circles. Their are a hardcore of people who&#8217;s blogs, books and conference appearances we&#8217;ve all seen several times over. And in the main I think this has had a positive effect on everyone involved. People like <a href="http://adaction.com">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> have at different times acted as pretty useful barometers and yard sticks for lots of people. But these people are invariably designers and developers &#8211; not product managers or project managers.</p>
<p>The only person I can think of who has talked a little about the topic of project management is <a href="http://blog.geekmanager.co.uk/">Meri</a> with her new book <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/project1/">Principles of Project Management</a>. The topic occasionally comes up in conversation, or is mentioned by the designers and developers noted above. And their are lots of blogs (more often by developers it seems) about Agile, XP and Scrumm. But what about the practice of web product management? You can point to countless blogs written by designers and developers at the likes of last.fm, flickr and Yahoo. But where are the managers?</p>
<p>So, my question to you is: do you know of any great web product or project managers that blog about the discipline?</p>

        @media: Designers Vs Developers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>Another successful <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2008/">@media</a> conference comes to a close and as usual interesting things were said and hopefully everyone learned something. As usual I have a few more things on my <em>must find time to play with</em> list. More on those if they happen.</p>
<p>But one part of the conference I felt needed addressing straight away was the first days panel. <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/sessions/#hottopics">The Hot Topics</a> panels bring together a few of the days speakers to answer questions posed by the audience. This year each day had it&#8217;s own panel discussion, with the first days session having a design theme. So far so good, and before I getting going I have to say I think <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeffrey Veen</a> did a sterling job of prodding and prompting the session along. The rest of the panel composed of <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Andy Clarke</a>, <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a>, <a href="http://presentimperfect.com/">Bronwyn Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.indiyoung.com/">Indi Young</a>.</p>
<p>The panel fielded a few interesting questions (and The Beatles in-joke was highly entertaining) but the whole thing took an odd turn part way through &#8211; odd in the sense that everything suddenly became very anti-developer.</p>
<p>Andy Clarke seemed to be the ring leader here saying things like (I&#8217;m paraphrasing here) &#8220;I hate daily stand-ups, we should do Agile&#8221;. Dan Rubin was involved too, seemingly saying all developers prefer the rigid nine to five because they&#8217;re logical people, while designers want to be able to work whenever they choose. This and other comments caused a few good friends and web developers on the front row to literally shake their fists in anger. The audience got involved too, cheering the anti-developer or anti-engineer statements on. In my mind damage had just been done to <del>out</del> <ins>our</ins> industry.</p>
<p>Buidling web sites or applications is a pretty multidisciplinary exercise, and in any team environment good communication is often the difference between executing well and failing badly. Conferences like @media are a great place to come together with people from different disciplines and similar jobs in different organisations and share stories. I&#8217;m not saying either Dan or Andy haven&#8217;t had bad experiences with developers or stand-ups. I&#8217;m not saying bad individuals or bad process don&#8217;t exist (I have scars from both). I&#8217;m saying that generalising these experiences and then promoting them to impressionable designers is dangerous.</p>
<p>I have the good fortune of working with a great designer, <a href="http://csensedesign.co.uk/blog/">Alex Lee</a>, at GCap at the moment. He&#8217;s involved in our stand-up meetings every morning and without him there we would waste untold amounts of time and effort. If he turned up on monday and said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to come to stand-ups anymore, Andy Clarke says they aren&#8217;t cool&#8221;. We have a massive problem. My fear is this is exactly what&#8217;s going to happen somewhere tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m something of a hybrid; I&#8217;ve run the whole gamut of design and development activities during my career to-date (I&#8217;ve even touched on project management) and have worked in small and medium sized agencies, as an independent freelancer and now in a decent sized in-house team. All of these roles pose different communication challenges which require different solutions. What works for three people in a distributed team doesn&#8217;t work for fifteen people working in-house. Some types and sizes of team work best with stand-ups, others work best being in the same small room together. Sometimes you need a centralised audit trail of everything that has happened on a project, other times it&#8217;s overkill. Somethings everyone has to be working on the project at the same time, at other times as long as tasks get done it really doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying I <em>like</em> all of those working conditions &#8211; I&#8217;m saying that if you understand where they work best you can work in the environment that suits you. Andy Clarke runs a <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/index.php/">boutique agency</a> doing high quality work, working with a very small team where individual flexibility and minimal process is definitely the best approach. I now work in a cross disciplinary team of maybe sixty people and it&#8217;s a different ball game completely.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an attack on Andy, or Dan, or even an anti-designer rant. The web is a young industry filled with young people. We&#8217;re learning as we go and stealing what we can from other disciplines. Also not that many of us really like the idea of project management, never mind the reality. Agile methods like Scrumm are hot at the moment but that&#8217;s not to say we won&#8217;t find something that better suites our discipline in the future. Iterative development, while often annoying to designers, appears to be producing better results. If designers, and developers, want to change how we work together for the better, then get interested in project management and lets have a discussion in public. If you want to complain about individual experiences then that&#8217;s why you have a blog.</p>
