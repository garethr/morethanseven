    <p>My first real foray into writing some simple Python scripts was a few scripts to establish the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunning-Fog_Index">Gunning-Fog</a> index of some given text. I wont go into lots of details about the uses of such a script; if you&#8217;re interested read Gez Lemons <a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php">writeup</a> over on <a href="http://juicystudio.com">Juicy Studio</a>.</p>
 <p>I took quite a bit of inspiration, and some code, from a similar script, <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/pyflesch/?branch_id=57281&#38;release_id=191977">PyFlesch</a>, for establising the Flesch reading score of text.</p>
 <p>I expanded things a little, using the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module to parse content from <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Atom feeds and give a Flesch or Gunning-Fog score of the summaries.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m a fan of <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> from <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>. Although you <em>can</em> make pages public their is currently no way to style those differently, or to add content from outside Backpack. That&#8217;s where Backgarden comes in. It&#8217;s a simple <span class="caps">PHP</span> (4 and 5, the <span class="caps">XML</span>/<span class="caps">XSL</span> implementations are slighly different) application that builds a page via the Backpack <span class="caps">API</span> and some <span class="caps">XSL</span> magic that you can put on your site. You just enter the page address and your <span class="caps">API</span> key.</p>

    <p>Content management is one of those subjects I often get involved in at work, and something I find pretty interesting as a whole &#8211; even if I keep having to reiterate most of the problems with content management are people problems rather than technological ones.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> for this site and a few others for a couple of years. I&#8217;ve spoken before about the recent move to more hand rolled solutions, and the flexibility that gives people to innovate. As well as occasionally threatening to really kick the tyres on <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> or similar (<a href="www.seaside.st">Seaside</a>, <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a>, &#8230;). I&#8217;ve been wandering the halls of the web development frameworks all year it seems &#8211; playing with <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> along the way.</p>
 <p>To a point however these seemed more developer focused that something I could see being used by a web designer or small company (some intentionally so in fairness) or in education. However I&#8217;m back playing with Rails and started looking at existing apps to see how they are put together (I love open source) and a quick recce of Rails based <span class="caps">CMS</span> products turned up (amongst others that didn&#8217;t interest) <a href="http://radiantcms.org/">Radiant</a>. It <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2006/09/12/site-launch-at-last/">appears</a> to have been developed along side the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">new Ruby site</a> launched in September and boy is it a nice piece of kit.</p>
 <p>Assuming you have Rails installed, installation of Radiant is as simple as one command (It&#8217;s available as a <a href="http://rubygems.org/">Gem</a>) and then another to get a site up and running (Ok, plus a couple of other simple commands to configure a database). First impressions it looks well put together, with a strong concept well executed and a lovely Interface. It&#8217;s chunky without being cliched and simple without being simplistic. I&#8217;m in the process of making plans for next year and this is hopefully going to feature somewhere. I love looking for a problem where I might just already have the solution.</p>
 <p>Oh, and a only vaguely related note (well, <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> is a content management system of sorts) a couple of friends have started blogging over on <a href="http://breadlinedesign.com">breadlinedesign.com</a> and <a href="http://anotherblog.com">anotherblog.com</a>. Consider this a shameless plug.</p>

        Food 2.0

    <span class="post-date">19 Dec 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m something of a want to be foodie. I&#8217;ve been a fan of food since working in a <a href="http://www.bentleys-foodandwine.co.uk/">restaurant</a> as a KP way back when I was at school. I like staying in and cooking, watching the odd food related progamme and going out to nice restaurants. However, I suddently realised it&#8217;s one of those things I dont yet do online. Most of the other things I do, or am interested in, I do at least in part online &#8211; except food.</p>
 <p>So I set out to see what I could find. I&#8217;d <a href="http://corkd.com/people/garethr/cellar">signed up</a> for <a href="http://corkd.com/">Cork&#8217;d</a> a while back after the buzz around the site in the web standards and Rails community. I&#8217;ve added a few wines and a few drinking buddies and keep thinking I should keep it up to date but&#8230;</p>
 <p>A quick search threw up <a href="http://chugd.com/">Chug&#8217;d</a>, <a href="http://www.menuism.com/">Menuism</a> and <a href="http://www.recipematcher.com/">Recipe matcher</a> to name but a few &#8211; all complete with Web 2.0 cliches. But nothing that really made me want to sign up. I&#8217;m not looking for a food community really, more a useful tool to store food related tit bits. Recipes. Which wine goes with what and when the best time to get perculier beers might be. Like a food focused version of <a href="http://backpackit.com">backpack</a> maybe? A mobile interface, hey maybe even a Palm based data entry setup would top things off nicely.</p>
 <p>Any other food people reading with a workflow that works? We&#8217;re always talking about software workflow or <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">getting things done</a> but what about something important like food!</p>

        Background Images in Email
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Dec 2006</span>

    <p>Whatever you might think about image rich emails you have to admit clients are a fan, and sometimes needs must.</p>
 <p>The web, as always, comes to the rescue and their are a few good articles around &#8211; many of them over on <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com">campaignmonitor.com</a> including a set of <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2005/11/html_email_desi.html">Email Design Guidelines for 2006</a>, <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2005/08/optimizing_css_1.html">Optimizing <span class="caps">CSS</span> presentation in <span class="caps">HTML</span> emails</a> and the excellent <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/blog/archives/2006/03/a_guide_to_css_1.html">A Guide to <span class="caps">CSS</span> Support in Email</a></p>
 <p><a href="http://alistapart.com/">A List Apart</a> also has an <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssemail/">older article</a> and their is some good infmation over on <a href="http://www.xavierfrenette.com">xavierfrenette.com</a> about the <a href="http://www.xavierfrenette.com/articles/css-support-in-webmail/">support in web mail clients</a>.</p>
 <p>Another little bit of useful info I thought worth posting, after a quick conversation with a colleague, concerns the use of background images in emails.</p>
 <p>Assuming your going down the inline styles route you might want to have something like this:</p>
<p><code>
&amp;lt;div style="background: url(image.jpg) top left no-repeat; width: 500px;"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;;
</code></p>
 <p>But this just doesn&#8217;t work. The image doesn&#8217;t appear when the email is sent. A quick fix is to include the image inline, but hide it as much as possible with a height and width of 1px and a style of display: none.</p>
<p><code>
&amp;lt;img src="image.jpg" width="1px" height="1px" style="display: none;"/&amp;gt;
</code></p>
 <p>This throws up one of those interesting annoyances in Outlook. If you&#8217;re sending the email using Outlook the image appears twice in the editing pane, hence the 1px trick as well as the style display: none. When it&#8217;s received the style rule gets applied.</p>
 <p>This assumes you are sending the images along with the email, rather than simply linking to them online were you dont have this problem &#8211; but do have a host of other issues with blocked images and the like.</p>
 <p>I haven&#8217;t admittedly tested this extensively, however I&#8217;ve had a lot of luck with Outlook, which for business to business emails accouts for something like 75% of the audience according to Campaign Monitor (and probably around what I&#8217;d expect based on my experience).</p>
