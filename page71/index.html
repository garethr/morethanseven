    <p>Of late I&#8217;ve found myself making quite a few smaller purchases of software. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of Open Source (and before that shareware &#8211; mainly on the ZX Spectrum) and still use lots of open source apps (anyone say Firefox) but for some really specific jobs it&#8217;s nice to have something you know is maybe a little more polished.</p>
 <p>I dont know if it&#8217;s just me getting older and having more disposable income, or a greater appreciation of what it takes to make really good software (probably a bit of both) but it&#8217;s sort of snuck up on me? Anyone else finding the same? I know <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a> has been mentioning some <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/happy-old-man">cool new apps</a> he&#8217;s using. What about everyone else?</p>
 <p>Recent purchase have included the following, nearly all bought with <a href="http://paypal.com">PayPal</a> as it happens:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.rogueamoeba.com/airfoil/">Airfoil</a> allows any sounds (mainly music) to be send round the house to speakers connected to my AirPort. Lovely.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nullriver.com/index/products/pspware">PSPWare</a> Like iSync but for my <span class="caps">PSP</span>. Also converts movies.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/">radioShark</a> Ok, software and hardware but useful at times.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.haveamint.com">Mint</a> I&#8217;ve mentioned before. Lovely stats.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I&#8217;m also evaluating (and at the moment being impressed by) a few other apps. Upcoming purchases probably.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://standalone.com/palmos/quick_news/">QuickNews</a> <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader (and podcasting app) for Palm OS.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.pocket-tunes.com/">PocketTunes</a> Good quality audio player for Palm OS, much better than the bundled Real Audio.</li>
  <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> The missing editor for OS X? Maybe. It&#8217;s toying with me at the moment to sit aside <a href="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">SubEthaEdit</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>On a blog related point, I&#8217;m aware I&#8217;ve been blogging more technology related stuff of late. I&#8217;ll be back with alot more web design and development banter soon, and some things happening up this neck of the woods (including a revamped <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia</a> site hopefully) &#8211; it&#8217;s a matter of having the ideas but not having the time! Hope it&#8217;s still all interesting to everyone.</p>

        The Meaning of  Scale
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m quite a <em>numbers</em> person and have something of a penchant for statistics  As if you couldn&#8217;t guess from the site name. So it is with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> (who also have a mathematical inspired site name). But unlike me they have more people (it&#8217;s just me) and lets face it, more computing power (only so many computers I can get in my house without getting told off).</p>
 <p>So they bring us something of a <a href="http://code.google.com/webstats/index.html">large, automated, study</a> (including some decent analysis) of what markup is <em>actually</em> being used, interestingly also including common class names. I&#8217;d love to do something like that &#8211; over 1,000,000,000 sites analysed!</p>
 <p>On a standards front seems to be good news and bad news, some of the common classes are things like:</p>
<ul>
 <li>footer  </li>
  <li>menu </li>
  <li>title, header, top </li>
  <li>small, smalltext </li>
  <li>text, content, main, body </li>
  <li>nav </li>
  <li>copyright </li>
  <li>search </li>
  <li>date</li>
</ul>
 <p>Most of those I can see use for. They <strong>Mean</strong> something for a start. Although some of the other top entries included things such as:</p>
<ul>
 <li>white</li>
  <li>link</li>
  <li><del>button</del></li>
  <li>style1 (my personal fave)</li>
</ul>
 <p>Which maybe aren&#8217;t as well chosen.</p>
 <p>On the other hand there are still lots of weirdness, proprietary   tags and bizarre attributes. iWeb might be using crazy nested divs but <a href="http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2006/01/26/iweb-is-not-evil">it&#8217;s still valid</a>.</p>
 <p>Being Google it&#8217;s all written fairly amusingly, including a few digs at competitors with applications which generate nightmare markup. Overall, a good read. There are probably a good number of other useful nuggets of information burried in the document as well. Anyone coming across anything of particular relevance leave a comment.</p>

    <p>Help! I&#8217;m not sure what to do? I appear to have been set upon by nearly published author <a href="http://collylogic.com">simon</a> in an attempt to spread a deadly meme. Oh well.</p>

        A Foundation to Build Javascript On
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>Like probably quite a few others I&#8217;m doing more Javascript of late, both professionally and at play. It&#8217;s not just the whole buzz around it, all the way back to <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">using Javascript for Good not Evil</a> but I moved away from doing backend development when I moved jobs, Javascript is most definately in my client side job remit.</p>
 <p>As an <a href="http://morethanseven.net/books">avid reader</a> I&#8217;ve got hold of  a few <a href="http://domscripting.com/book/">good quality</a> <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/dhtml1/">Javascript books</a> that have come along and was on the lookout for more when I came upon <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">Foundations of <span class="caps">AJAX</span></a> from <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress&#8217;s</a> black and yellow experts voice series. I haven&#8217;t read enough to give a full conclusion but I&#8217;ve been impressed with other books in the series and it looks promising so far. A few chapters did stand out (I jumped in and read them first) that had little to do with <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, concentrating instead on setting up a proper Javascript development environment.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m not a fan of bloated IDEs so the lack of one for Javascript doesn&#8217;t bother me as much as it does some. However debugging by browser is a pain for simple scripts, never mind larger applications. Firefox&#8217;s Javascript Console is mighty handy here, as is the <span class="caps">DOM</span> inspector and the <a href="http://jennifermadden.com/scripts/ViewRenderedSource.html">view rendered source</a> extension. There is also the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2f465be0-94fd-4569-b3c4-dffdf19ccd99&#38;DisplayLang=en">Windows Script Debugger</a> but I personally haven&#8217;t had much luck with that as yet.</p>
 <p>Projects should have documentation and code should have comments. But it&#8217;s time consuming (honestly). Automatic generation of docs from source comments both makes you comment more efficiently and comprehensively <em>and</em> saves time. Everyone&#8217;s happy, at least as long as they are using the <a href="http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net/">JSDoc</a> perl application to do just that. Anyone familiar with Java will have come across JDoc and the name isn&#8217;t the only similarity. It&#8217;s now installed and ready to be used next time I write any Javascript.</p>
 <p>Another area of interest recently has been application design, analysis and methodology, so I&#8217;d come across the idea of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">test driven development</a> before and experimented briefly &#8211; but not with Javascript. The idea is that you write tests that can be run automatically on your finished code before you write the code, it makes you <em>design</em> more which cant be a bad think. Anyway, Javascript has <a href="http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/">JSUnit</a>, a nice unit testing framework. Again, installed and ready to give it a whirl.</p>
 <p>Hopefully this brief list will prove useful to anyone else making more use of Javascript recently and looking to be more productive. Anyone else with any other useful tools do post a comment, or is their a mythical application that you just wish existed to help you with your Javascript woes?</p>
