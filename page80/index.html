    <p>I&#8217;ve just install the ShortStat package from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">www.shauninman.com</a>   and the Mac OS X widget from <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/">www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/</a> to go along with it. My desktop now tells me how few people are visiting my site!</p>
 <p>It&#8217;s the first really useful widget I can see myself using for more than pure eye candy.</p>
 <p>And ShortStat itself seems to be a very nice addition. Simple to set up and the output is nice and clear.</p>
 <p>To both the people visiting the site &#8211; dont worry I wont use your browsing habits for anything other than improving the site!</p>

    <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>It&#8217;s official. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m reading the <span class="caps">DHTML</span> Utopia book at the moment (excellent so far) and following on from @Media it does seem to be where it&#8217;s at, at least for a little while.</p>
 <p>The discussion of naming raised it&#8217;s head and I kind of agree &#8211; <span class="caps">AJAX</span> has buzz word written all over it. Read the full article at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/you_shouldve_be_1.html">quirksmode.org</a> following on from the Javascript get together after @media (darn train tickets).</p>
 <p>If <span class="caps">CSS</span> is too much for designery types just wait&#8230; <span class="caps">CSS</span>, without its programmatic concepts (variables? arrays? etc.) is one thing but Javascript is, lets remember, an Object Orientated scripting language. Interesting to see who ends up doing this sort of work in small companies with limited people.</p>

    <p>Sorry for the title. As a few people already know I&#8217;m moving jobs at the end of the month to Th_nk. Basically to do more web design with the emphasis on <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and the like.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m not going to go on about it as I&#8217;m trying to stick to issues on here about web stuff rather than about me but thought it worth a post.</p>

    <p>Wow. I&#8217;m still pretty wired after two days of conference and several late nights but boy was it worth the effort and more.</p>
 <p>First I just want to say a big thanks to Patrick (<a href="http://www.htmldog.com">htmldog.com</a>) for organising the event and to all the speakers and attendees I spoke to.</p>
 <p>I must mention Molly Holzschlag (<a href="http://www.molly.com">www.molly.com</a>) individually for being amazing thought. Thanks for the beer.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get something more useful up here with more salient points over the next couple of weeks but for the moment I just want to say it was an inspirational couple of days, and make sure to watch the blogs of the speakers for real indepth stuff (rather than just awe).</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve of late been playing around with a number of different ways of storing bookmarks after realising I was just not bothering before. I added del.icio.us links to the site a bit ago and I&#8217;ve just come across Scuttle (<a href="http://scuttle.org">scuttle.org</a>) which is a <span class="caps">GPL</span> <span class="caps">PHP</span> del.icio.us clone which is really quite nice.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve set it up at the moment on one of my machines and might look to add a styled and modified version to this site as time and inclination allow.</p>
