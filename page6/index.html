        Government Service Design Manual
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve not been writing many blog posts lately, but I have been doing quite a bit of writing elsewhere. One of the things I&#8217;ve had a hand in at work is the new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual">Government Service Design Manual</a>. This is the work of many people I work with as well as further afield. It&#8217;s intended to be a good starting place to find information about building high quality digital services.</p>
<p>The manual is in beta and we&#8217;re looking for as much feedback as possible on the whole thing. It&#8217;s already proving useful and a good way of framing the scope of discussions, but it has lots of room for improvement.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re reading this post I&#8217;m going to wager you&#8217;re interest lies in or around devops flavoured content. The following are guides I&#8217;ve written in this area that I&#8217;d love any and all feedback on.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/web-operations.html">Web Operations</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/configuration-management.html">Configuration Management</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/operations/hosting.html">Hosting</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/operations/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/operations/load-and-performance-testing.html">Load and Performance Testing</a></li>

	<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/making-software/choosing-technology.html">Choosing Technology</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in the background to this endeavour then a couple of blog posts from some of my colleagues might be of interest too. First Richard Pope talks about <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/21/building-the-standard/">how the manual came about</a> and here&#8217;s a post from Andrew Greenway about this <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/21/building-the-standard/">beta testing of the service standard</a>.</p>
<p>The source for all this is on <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/government-service-design-manual">GitHub</a> so if you prefer you can just sent a pull request. Or I&#8217;m happy to get emails or comments on this post. In particular if people have good references or next steps for these guides then let me know as several of them in particular are lacking in that area.</p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>I had fun speaking at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon</a> in London earlier this month with a talk on the Cloud track entitled the Perils of Portability.</p>
<p>This had some Governmenty stuff in but was mainly part rant, part hope for the future of cloud infrastructure. I had some great conversations with people afterwards who felt some of the similar pain which was nice to know. I also somehow managed to get 120 slides into a 40 minute presentation which I think is a personal records.</p>

    <span class="post-date">17 Feb 2013</span>

    <p>With only a week or so to go before the end of February, it&#8217;s looking like March might be a little busy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m speaking at QCon, in London on Wednesday 6th on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Clouds%20in%20Government%20-%20Perils%20of%20Portability">Clouds in Government &#8211; Perils of Portability</a> (which in hindsight is probably the silliest title for a talk I&#8217;ve ever used)</li>
	<li>On the 15th and 16th of March I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/">Devopsdays</a>, again in London. I&#8217;ve been helping out with organising the event and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to going along after seeing all the work being put in.</li>
	<li>And last but not least I&#8217;m heading to Boston for the rather exciting <a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> from the 26th until the 30th. Looking forward to meeting up in person with quite a few folks I&#8217;ve spoken to over the last year or two.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be at any of these events (QCon and Devopsdays still have tickets available I think) then let me know.</p>

    <p>About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/">London Web Performance</a> meetup. This was one of the first talks I&#8217;ve done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.</p>

    <p>I had great fun back in November at the <a href="http://qconsf.com/">QCon</a> conference in San Francisco. As well as currating one of the tracks and catching up with people in the area I managed to give the following talk.</p>
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="7e1dd5a03efc0130083b123139173def" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script><p>In hindsight it might have been a bit odd to try and cover both Rails and Django examples in the one presentation but it was quite good fun putting together code examples using both of them at the same time. As well as a large set of tips, tricks and tools I settled on a few things that I think any web (or other) framework should support out of the box.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A debug toolbar</li>
	<li>Transparent caching support</li>
	<li>Hooks for instrumentation</li>
	<li>Configurable logging</li>
