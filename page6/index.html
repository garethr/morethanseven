        Riemann Puppet Module
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Thanks to an <a href="https://twitter.com/bitprophet/status/233626675307479040">errant tweet</a> I started playing with <a href="http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/">Riemann</a> again. It ticks lots of boxes for me, from the clojure to configuration as code and the overloadable dashboard application. What started as using Puppet and Vagrant to investigate Riemann turned into a full blown tool and module writing exercise, resulting in two related projects on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-riemann/">garethr-riemann</a> is a Puppet module for installing and configuring Riemann. It allows for easily specifying your own server configuration and dashboard views.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/riemann-vagrant">riemann-vagrant</a> is a Vagrantfile and other code which uses above puppet module to setup a local testing environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this combination, a separate Puppet module along with a vagrant powered test bed. I&#8217;ve written a reasonable rspec based test suite to check the module but it&#8217;s always easier to be able to run <em>vagrant provision</em> as well to check everything is working. This also turned out to be the perfect opportunity to use <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian-Puppet</a> to manage the dependencies and eventually to ship the module to the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Puppet Forge</a>.</p>

        The Vagrantbox.es Story
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>A few weeks ago now <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> (a website I maintain for third party hosted <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> base boxes) dissapeared from the internet for a few days. This was completely my fault, the (lovely) hosting people <a href="https://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a> had unfortunately closed down the service they had in beta and I&#8217;d been so busy that I hadn&#8217;t had chance to move it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The original version of the site (I had the code and good backups of the data) was a pretty simple Django application, but I&#8217;d used it to experiment (read over-engineer) with various bits of tech including Varnish, Solr, some <span class="caps">ORM</span> caching and lots more. This had been great, but it made it less portable. I had everything described in Puppet, but with virtually no spare time I decided to go a different route.</p>
<p>I threw a flat version of the site up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>, served it using Nginx on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and added a quick <em>Fork me on GitHub</em> badge to the top. Suggest a box moved from being a web form to a pull request. It&#8217;s fair to say I did this pretty quickly and made a good few typos on the way. But within a couple of weeks I&#8217;ve had 8 pull requests either fixing my bugs, removing dead boxes and adding new ones.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m going to take from this is, if you&#8217;re building a community project that&#8217;s aimed at developers, then throw the content on GitHub. In my case I have the entire site on there too but I think that&#8217;s secondary. Pull requests are much better than any content management system or workflow you&#8217;re likely to build, and even more importantly the time to implement something drops hugely.</p>
<p>With all the spare time I don&#8217;t have I&#8217;ll be thinking about a content management model using GitHub for content, pull requests for workflow and post commit hooks for loading that content into a site or service somewhere.</p>

        Static Sites With Nginx On Heroku
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2012</span>

    <p>I have a few static sites on Heroku but in one case in particular I already had quite an involved nginx configuration &#8211; mainly 410s for some previous content and a series of redirects from older versions of the site. The common way of having static sites on Heroku appears to be to use a simple Rack middleware, but that would have meant reimplementing lots of boring redirect logic.</p>
<p>Heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a> are great. The newer cedar stack is no longer tied to a particular language or framework, instead all of the discovery and knowledge about particular software is put into a buildpack. As well as the Heroku provided list it&#8217;s possible to write you&#8217;re own. Or in this case use one someone has <a href="https://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx">created earlier</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just moved <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> over to Heroku due to the closure of a previous service. In doing that, instead of the simple database backed app, I&#8217;ve simply thrown all the content onto <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>. This means anyone can fork the content and send pull requests. Hopefully this should mean I pay a bit more attention to suggestions and new boxes.</p>
<p>The repository is a nice simple example of using the mentioned Heroku Nginx buildpack too. You just run the following command to create a new Heroku application.</p>
<pre>heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx.git</pre>
<p>And then in typical Heroku fashion use a git remote to deploy changes and updates. The repository is split into a <em>www</em> folder with the site content and a <em>conf</em> folder with the nginx configuration. The only clever parts involve the use of an <span class="caps">ERB</span> template for the nginx configuration file so we can pickup the correct port. We also use 1 worker process and don&#8217;t automatically daemonize the process &#8211; Heroku deals with this itself.</p>

    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2012</span>

    <p>Several things seemed to come together at once to make me want to hack on this particular project. In no particular order:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/articles/technology-radar-march-2012">Thoughtworks Technology Radar</a> said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embedding a servlet container, such as Jetty, inside a Java application has many advantages over running the application inside a container. Testing is relatively painless because of the simple startup, and the development environment is closer to production. Nasty surprises like mismatched versions of libraries or drivers are eliminated by not sharing across multiple applications. While you will have to manage and monitor multiple Java Virtual Machines in production using this model, we feel the advantages offered by the simplicity and isolation are significant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting more interested in JRuby anyway, partly because we&#8217;re finding ourselves using both Ruby and Scala at work, and maintaining a single target platform makes sense to me. Throw in the potential for interop between those languages and it&#8217;s certainly worth investigating.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.playframework.org/">Play 2.0</a> shipped and currently only provides the ability to create a self contained executable with bundled web server. Creating <span class="caps">WAR</span> files for more traditional application servers is on the roadmap but interestingly wasn&#8217;t deemed essential for the big 2.0 release. I had a nice chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/minglis">Martyn Inglis</a> at work about some of the nice side effects of this setup.</p>
<p>And throw in every time I have to configure straight Ruby applications for production environments I get cross. I know where all the bits and pieces are buried and can do it well, but with so many moving parts it&#8217;s absolutely no fun whatsoever.</p>
<p>Warbler, the JRuby tool for creating <span class="caps">WAR</span> files from Ruby source, has just added the ability to <a href="https://github.com/jruby/warbler/commit/0558a285eb59a0801cf7c0f274777b06b63883b3">embed Jetty to the master branch</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to take all of this for a quick spin, and the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/jruby-embedded-jetty">resulting code is up on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This is the simplest Rack application possible, it just prints <em>Hello Jetty</em>. And the <span class="caps">README</span> covers how to install and run it so I won&#8217;t duplcate that information here.</p>
<p>But I will print some nearly meaningless and unscientific benchmarks because, hey, who doesn&#8217;t like those?</p>

<p>2736 requests per second on JRuby/Jetty vs 1600 on Ruby/Thin. As noted this isn&#8217;t meaningfully useful, in that it&#8217;s a hello world example and I&#8217;ve not tried to pick the fastest stacks on either side. I&#8217;m more bothered about it not being slower, because the main reason to pursue this approach is simplicity. Having a single self contained artefact that contains all it&#8217;s dependencies including a production web server is very appealing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hoping to give this a go with some less trivial applications, and probably more importantly look to compare a production stack based around these self-contained executables vs the dependency chain that is modern Ruby application stacks.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/">Nick Sieger</a> for both writing Warbler and for helping with a few questions on the JRuby mailing list and on Twitter. Thanks also to <a href="https://twitter.com/jabley">James Abley</a> for a few pointers on Java system properties.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been pretty busy with all things <a href="https://www.gov.uk"><span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a> recently but I&#8217;ve managed to get a few bits of unrelated code up and a few talks in. I&#8217;m <em>still</em> pretty busy so here&#8217;s a list of some of them rather than a proper blog post.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/mining-puppet">Puppet Data Mining</a> talk from last weeks PuppetCamp in Edinburgh.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/web-operations">Introducting Web Operations</a> talk I gave at work to give my mainly non-development colleagues an idea about what it&#8217;s all about.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/learnings-from-govuk">Learning from building <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a> talk I gave a month back or so to Cambridge Geek Night. We did an excellent full project retrospective after the beta launch and this lists some of the things we learnt.</li>
</ul>
<p>After someone bugged me on Twitter I realised the small bit of code we&#8217;ve been using for our Nagios dashboard wasn&#8217;t out in the wild. So introducing <a href="https://github.com/garethr/nash">Nash</a>, a very simple high level check dashboard which screenscrapes nagiosand runs happily on Heroku.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve not been writing too much on here I&#8217;ve been keeping <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/">Devops Weekly</a> going each week for over a year now. I&#8217;ve just crossed 3000 subscribers which is pretty neat for a pet project.</p>
