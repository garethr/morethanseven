    <span class="post-date">23 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>I had fun speaking at <a href="http://qconlondon.com/">QCon</a> in London earlier this month with a talk on the Cloud track entitled the Perils of Portability.</p>
<p>This had some Governmenty stuff in but was mainly part rant, part hope for the future of cloud infrastructure. I had some great conversations with people afterwards who felt some of the similar pain which was nice to know. I also somehow managed to get 120 slides into a 40 minute presentation which I think is a personal records.</p>

    <p>With only a week or so to go before the end of February, it&#8217;s looking like March might be a little busy.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I&#8217;m speaking at QCon, in London on Wednesday 6th on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Clouds%20in%20Government%20-%20Perils%20of%20Portability">Clouds in Government &#8211; Perils of Portability</a> (which in hindsight is probably the silliest title for a talk I&#8217;ve ever used)</li>
	<li>On the 15th and 16th of March I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/">Devopsdays</a>, again in London. I&#8217;ve been helping out with organising the event and I&#8217;m very much looking forward to going along after seeing all the work being put in.</li>
	<li>And last but not least I&#8217;m heading to Boston for the rather exciting <a href="http://monitorama.com/">Monitorama</a> from the 26th until the 30th. Looking forward to meeting up in person with quite a few folks I&#8217;ve spoken to over the last year or two.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to be at any of these events (QCon and Devopsdays still have tickets available I think) then let me know.</p>

    <p>About a month ago I had the good fortune of speaking at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Web-Performance-Group/">London Web Performance</a> meetup. This was one of the first talks I&#8217;ve done about our work at The Government Digital Service since the luanch of <span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK back in October. The topic was all about moving quickly in a large organisation (The UK Civil Service is about 450,000 people so I think it counts) and featured just a hand full of technical and organisational tricks we used.</p>

    <p>I had great fun back in November at the <a href="http://qconsf.com/">QCon</a> conference in San Francisco. As well as currating one of the tracks and catching up with people in the area I managed to give the following talk.</p>

As well as a large set of tips, tricks and tools I settled on a few things that I think any web (or other) framework should support out of the box.</p>
<ul>
	<li>A debug toolbar</li>
	<li>Transparent caching support</li>
	<li>Hooks for instrumentation</li>
	<li>Configurable logging</li>

        my personal package repository

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Dec 2012</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages/">big fan of system packages for lots of reasons</a> and have often ended up rolling my own debian package repository at work, or working with others that have done so. Recently I finally got round to setting up a personal package repo, at <a href="http://packages.garethrushgrove.com">packages.garethrushgrove.com</a>. More interesting than the repo is probably the tool chain I used, oh and the rather nice bootstrap based styling.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjh1wIM" alt="nice looking package repository"/></p>
<p>The source code for everything is <a href="https://github.com/garethr/packages">on GitHub</a> although not much documentation exists yet. In the middle are a few shell scripts that generate the repo. Around them is a Vagrant box (which makes it easier to build packages for different achitectures or distros) and some Rake commands</p>
<pre><code>bundle exec rake -T
rake recipes:build[recipe]  # Build a package from one of the available recipes
rake recipes:list           # List available recipes
rake repo:build             # Build the repository</code></pre>
<p>The recipes commands allow for building new packages based on scripts. A few examples are included which use fpm, but you could use anything. The repo:build command triggers the debian repository to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The vagrant configuration shares various folders between and guest and host which also opens up a few useful features. One is I can just drop any old debian package into the debs folder and run the repo:build command and it will be in my repository. The other useful capability is that the resulting repo is shared back to the host, which means I can then check it into Git and in my case push it up to Heroku.</p>
