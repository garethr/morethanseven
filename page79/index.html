    <p>I&#8217;m something of a fan of mobile devices and really should do more mobile web stuff but hey, the support for mobile <span class="caps">CSS</span> is shody at best. Enter <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/07/make-your-site-mobile-friendly">this article</a>.</p>
 <p>The idea is really pretty simple. All you really want when your paying for bandwidth on your phone (or you <span class="caps">PDA</span> connected to your phone via bluetooth) is the content. So lets get rid of everything (and we mean everything) else. The solution is fairly devious &#8211; using some <span class="caps">PHP</span> jiggery pokery, a sub domain and some text parsing.</p>
 <p>Have a look at <a href="http://mobile.morethanseven.net">mobile.morethanseven.net</a> for an example on this site.</p>
 <p>In reality it&#8217;s a non ideal solution, but considerng it really does take two minutes I dont see that as a problem, and I think that was what the author of the article was getting at. We want to use mobile <span class="caps">CSS</span> but some browsers ignore it while others pretend they are grown up browsers and try and render the whole site <span class="caps">CSS</span> file.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m hopefully going to alter this a little, rather than removing all stylesheets leaving any  mobile media sheets intact. Assign these to the main site and we have an interim solution. Fancy devices that make use of the correct style sheets can use the main domain fine, others can get the same design by visiting the mobile sub domain.</p>

    <p>For those like me behind the times, I was quite impressed to get passed the batton (thanks <a href="http://www.xlab.co.uk">phil</a>)</p>
 <p><strong>Total volume of music on my computer</strong><br />
    19.51Gb<br />
<strong>Last CD I bought</strong><br />
    Foo Fighters &#8211; In Your Honor<br />
<strong>Song playing right now?</strong><br />
    Well the last song I listened to was The English Motorway System by Black Box Recorder</p>
 <p><strong>5 songs that I listen to a lot or mean something to me?</strong></p>
<ol>
 <li>Ash &#8211; Dancing on the Moon, Jesus Says B-side</li>
  <li>Johnny Cash &#8211; Hurt</li>
  <li>Easyworld &#8211; Goodnight</li>
  <li>Jimmy Eat World &#8211; The World You Love</li>
  <li>R.E.M. Strange Currencies</li>
</ol>
 <p>Note that that list probably changes every day but hey, that&#8217;s for today. I quite like <a href="http://www.collylogic.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/music_monthlies_july_2005/">Simon&#8217;s</a> music monthlies idea but dont know whether I could ever really get round to it. Oh well.</p>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2005</span>

    <p>Been a little busy with the new job but had chance to do a few behind the scenes bits and pieces, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>valid and formatted feed</li>
  <li>blogroll from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/projects/12">StripComments </a> project</li>
  <li>autocomplete on search box (type c, x or p)</li>
  <li>added <a href="http://www.textism.com">Textile</a> formatting for posts</li>
</ul>
 <p>Should be back with more soon. I need to reply to phil (<a href="http://xlab.co.uk">xlab</a>) about my musical preferences, jot down notes on using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> as an online feed reader and a web standards redoing of the <a href="http://www.qwikiwiki.com">QWikiWiki</a> output layer that I&#8217;m part way through.</p>

    <p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</strong> Visiting the website I now find out that after the next mini issue it&#8217;s all over for Design in Flight. I can see how it could take over someone&#8217;s life considering the quality but I for one would have paid more to keep it around.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve just got round to buying all the back issues of Design in Flight (<a href="http://www.designinflight.com">www.designinflight.com</a>) magazine &#8211; which features articles on design, web development and similar fields.</p>
 <p>For only 10 dollars (via Pay Pal) for the 4 issues it seems excellent value at about 150 pages or so, brimming with interesting information.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve obviously not read that much as yet but so far so good and for the price you cant really go wrong.</p>

    <p>After a little work I&#8217;ve put together an app to keep up to date with all the news around @media. Based on the collection of feeds from <a href="http://kurafire.net">kurafire.net</a> it collects and filters for posts for @media references and displays them.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m hoping it will proove useful to anyone else who wants to keep up to date. Especially when details start coming up about next year and in the lead up to that.</p>
 <p>Have a look at <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">morethanseven.net/atmedia</a>. If you have any more feeds just let me know &#8211; I want it to be as extensive as possible.</p>
