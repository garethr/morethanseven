        more from @media
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>With all the goings on off the back of @media its pretty hard to keep up. Many of the ideas that where discussed seem to be taking hold and coming into the world and lots of sites have had some recdent <span class="caps">TLC</span>. Anyway, here goes with a few observations.</p>
 <p><strong>Simplified Standards</strong><br />
Simplifiedstandards (<a href="http://www.simplifiedstandards.com/">simplifiedstandards.com</a>) looks like a great idea. A few people where discussing a central repository for concensus on issues of web standards application in the real world and this aims to be just that. Simon Collison of <a href="http://www.collylogic.com">www.collylogic.com</a> is bringing everything together as far as I can see.</p>
 <p><strong>Everyones thoughts</strong><br />
Faruk AteÃ…Å¸ appears to have spent every day since getting back compiling a list of what anyone anywhere said about the event. Its a great idea and makes finding peoples thoughts easier but I wonder if their would be an easy way of doing this (like pinging a web service with any new articles?) without one guy doing all the work?<br />
Look for everyones comments at <a href="http://www.kurafire.net/log/archive/2005/06/11/atmedia-2005-report">kurafire.net</a></p>
 <p><strong>Designersinhouse</strong><br />
One guy I did meet at the conference was Matt Patterson who has set up a small (but radidly growing) mainling list over at <a href="http://www.designersinhouse.com">www.designersinhouse.com</a> aimed at designers working within larger organisations. One thing I took away from the conference was the large number of people working outside service or agency environments.</p>
 <p>And that is just some of the goings on. A good amount of discussion going on around the level of legislation needed to govern accessibility doing the rounds, the <span class="caps">ATF</span> (Accessibility TaskForce) from WaSP just starting up with several of the speakers on board and god knows what else. Oh, and I still haven&#8217;t done a zoom layout but I did add some word completion to the search box!</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just install the ShortStat package from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com">www.shauninman.com</a>   and the Mac OS X widget from <a href="http://www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/">www.keeganjones.com/widgets/shortstat/</a> to go along with it. My desktop now tells me how few people are visiting my site!</p>
 <p>It&#8217;s the first really useful widget I can see myself using for more than pure eye candy.</p>
 <p>And ShortStat itself seems to be a very nice addition. Simple to set up and the output is nice and clear.</p>
 <p>To both the people visiting the site &#8211; dont worry I wont use your browsing habits for anything other than improving the site!</p>

        DOM Scripting. Its the future?

    <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>It&#8217;s official. It&#8217;s <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m reading the <span class="caps">DHTML</span> Utopia book at the moment (excellent so far) and following on from @Media it does seem to be where it&#8217;s at, at least for a little while.</p>
 <p>The discussion of naming raised it&#8217;s head and I kind of agree &#8211; <span class="caps">AJAX</span> has buzz word written all over it. Read the full article at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/06/you_shouldve_be_1.html">quirksmode.org</a> following on from the Javascript get together after @media (darn train tickets).</p>
 <p>If <span class="caps">CSS</span> is too much for designery types just wait&#8230; <span class="caps">CSS</span>, without its programmatic concepts (variables? arrays? etc.) is one thing but Javascript is, lets remember, an Object Orientated scripting language. Interesting to see who ends up doing this sort of work in small companies with limited people.</p>

    <span class="post-date">16 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>Sorry for the title. As a few people already know I&#8217;m moving jobs at the end of the month to Th_nk. Basically to do more web design with the emphasis on <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and the like.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m not going to go on about it as I&#8217;m trying to stick to issues on here about web stuff rather than about me but thought it worth a post.</p>

    <p>Wow. I&#8217;m still pretty wired after two days of conference and several late nights but boy was it worth the effort and more.</p>
 <p>First I just want to say a big thanks to Patrick (<a href="http://www.htmldog.com">htmldog.com</a>) for organising the event and to all the speakers and attendees I spoke to.</p>
 <p>I must mention Molly Holzschlag (<a href="http://www.molly.com">www.molly.com</a>) individually for being amazing thought. Thanks for the beer.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get something more useful up here with more salient points over the next couple of weeks but for the moment I just want to say it was an inspirational couple of days, and make sure to watch the blogs of the speakers for real indepth stuff (rather than just awe).</p>
