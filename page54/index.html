        JSON configuration example - Printing

    <p>As a quick follow up to my <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/unobtrusive-javascript-example-printing/">previous post on unobtrusive javascript</a> I thought I&#8217;d expand it even more, but this time in an attempt to make it easier to use.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve already mentioned javascript should be treated like any other programming language &#8211; not necessarily left to the experts but their should ideally be an expert involved somewhere along the line. One way of doing this is to abstract out configuration from programmatic logic. This massively helps with code resuse as well, leaving everyone to play to their strengths. It&#8217;s interesting to note that even programmers who would always store configuration settings seperately when writing <span class="caps">PHP</span> or Rails applications don&#8217;t always get around to doing the same in Javascript. Hell, I used to be one of them until <a href="http://wait-till-i.com/">Chris Heilmann</a> pointed out how patently obvious the solution was while at <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">The Highland Fling</a>.</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="http://www.json.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span></a>. I think it&#8217;s nearly always easier with a quick example so here&#8217;s the Print snippet from the previous post but this time with a few configurable options:</p>
<pre><code>var Print = {
   config: {
      "id": "iNav",
      "classname": "has-print",
      "text": "Print"
   },
   init: new domFunction(function() {
      if (list = document.getElementById(Print.config.id)) {
         if (list.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'ul') {
            if (Print.hasClass(list,Print.config.classname)) {
               var item = document.createElement("li");
               item.className = "print";
               var link = document.createElement("a");
               link.href = "#";
               link.onclick = Print.printpage;
               var txt = document.createTextNode(Print.config.text);
               link.appendChild(txt);
               item.appendChild(link);
               list.appendChild(item);
            }
         }
      }
   }),
   hasClass: function(element,cName) { 
      return new RegExp('\\b''&amp;#43;cName'&amp;#43;'\\b').test(element.className);
   },
   printpage: function() {
      window.print();
      return false;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>The main thing we have done is to add a new block:</p>
<pre><code>config: {
   "id": "iNav",
   "classname": "has-print",
   "text": "brand new text"
},</code></pre>
<p>This is simply a <span class="caps">JSON</span> object of name/value pairs. You can easily alter the right hand values and change the workings of the app. You then reference the settings in  the rest of you&#8217;re code using dot notation:</p>
<pre><code>Print.config.text</code></pre>
<p>In the above example our configuration directives are stored in our Print object. Depending on the circumstances of use you might find it easier to have a seperate Config object which stores all the configuration settings for the entire site.</p>

        Unobtrusive Javascript Example - Printing

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 May 2007</span>

    <p>In lieu of some real posts here&#8217;s a quick code sample to keep things ticking along.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had the need to place a nice print button on a web page from time to time. If you haven&#8217;t you&#8217;re probably alone. A quick google will throw up lots of results for print javascript &#8211; the problem is that most of them are horribly obtrusive.</p>
<p>OK, so it&#8217;s easy to write something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="window.print();"&gt;print&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
<p>But the problem is <em>What if you turn off javascript?</em> The following unobtrusive script automagically adds a print link to the page &#8211; in this case as part of a list item which is added to the unordered list with the id of <em>iNav</em> and a class of <em>has-print</em>.</p>
<pre><code>var Print = {
   init: new domFunction(function() {
      if (list = document.getElementById("iNav")) {
         if (list.nodeName.toLowerCase() === 'ul') {
            if (Print.hasClass(list,'has-print')) {
               var item = document.createElement("li");
               item.className = "print";
               var link = document.createElement("a");
               link.href = "#";
               link.onclick = Print.printpage;
               var txt = document.createTextNode("Print");
               link.appendChild(txt);
               item.appendChild(link);
               list.appendChild(item);
            }
         }
      }
   }),

   hasClass: function(element,cName) { 
      return new RegExp('\\b'&amp;#43;cName&amp;#43;'\\b').test(element.className);
   },

   printpage: function() {
      window.print();
      return false;
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>With something like this you want it to load as soon as the dom is ready, rather than on page load. <a href="http://www.brothercake.com">Brothercake&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/domready/">domFunction</a> comes to the rescue here. The namespacing is based on <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Stuarts</a> technique which should make it more capable of just being dropped in to any site.</p>
<p>The only problem with this is that it&#8217;s just a little longer than the original. I think this is down to one often missed fact, at least until recently &#8211; Javascript is a programming language and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>So, who else is going along and does anyone have any ideas they want team mates for? I&#8217;m thinking something mobile or microformats related or alternatively something I know very little about. Any ideas?</p>
<p>Oh, and I know I&#8217;ve been quite around the place lately, more on that when I can talk about it.</p>

    <p><a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy</a> gave a great thought provoking presentation (exactly what conference presentations should be) at the recent <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">Highland Fling</a> shindig on the future of <span class="caps">CSS</span> which he&#8217;s written up into a good thought provoking blog post on <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/index.php">CSS2.2</a></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>As web standards developers we want new toys! I took to <span class="caps">CSS</span> because <em>it made sense</em> set against the madness of table based layouts, not necessarily because it appeared easy or flexible. <span class="caps">CSS</span> has turned out to be hugely flexible, but some of that flexibility has come at the expense of some weird and wonderful and successful techniques. I love this ingenuity, I&#8217;d like to think that the original <span class="caps">CSS</span> specification allowed for this cleverness in real world use.</p>
<p>CSS3 has stalled. CSS3 is trying to solve a whole host of massive problems that others are better placed to comment on, but I&#8217;d love to hear some comment from members of the working group. If I&#8217;ve missed a regular blog by a working group member please leave a comment and let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a real believer in open standards and I think that it&#8217;s this issue that worries me more about the pace of <span class="caps">CSS</span> development. Yes, I want new toys, or more specifically I want to be more efficient (yes rounded corners, I&#8217;m looking at you) but actually, I&#8217;d rather have a good CSS3 spec than a fast and loose one. But the immenent fight between Flash/Adobe and Silverlight/Microsoft is showing how productive huge commercial companies can be when it wants to get something done. Both are introducing interesting new tools and allowing for what could be improvements to usability (or horribly confusing interfaces but hey). <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> should be the glue that binds all this together in a web where everything plays nicely together. But if <span class="caps">CSS</span> provides too little or too late then this is put in doubt. And if <span class="caps">CSS</span> falls I dont see microformats, rdf, html5 or whatever making a real dent &#8211; and I really want a semantic web (upper <strong>and</strong> lower case).</p>
<h3>The Solution?</h3>
<p>Well, I&#8217;d like to say the solution isn&#8217;t <em>Browser Wars II &#8211; A good idea this time?</em></p>
<p>Andy&#8217;s suggestion of an interim step (or steps) between now and CSS3 modules raises a problem. If the working group do the work then it takes their eye further off getting CSS3 modules out. If they don&#8217;t, will they accept suggestions from outside? Will outsiders be able to grok the whole standardisation process?</p>
<p>What we need is a commercial company with lots of smart people and lots of cash &#8211; with a track record of working with standards. A member of the W3C would be a plus. Ideally they should have something invested in the web as a platform, maybe even in a smarter, cleverer, semantic web.</p>
<p>Google to the rescue maybe? If you&#8217;re really cynical you could see Silverlight as an end run around Google&#8217;s apparent dominance of the web as a platform. Lock content away in proprietary silos and traditional search becomes less appealing? And surely Google has lots to gain from the long term adoption of anything that increases the semantic nature of the web. If <span class="caps">CSS</span> is a battleground then maybe they need to come out and make a stand(ard)?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/authoritative-hcards-authority-in-microformats/">authority in microformats</a> and as a result been taking a closer look at <a href="http://microid.org">microID</a>.</p>
<p>The situation I want to find a solution for is; If their are lots of published hcards for a given person they might be different, either out of date or more sinisterly fraudulent. If I do a search for contact details, lets say using the <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">technorati hcard search engine</a>, how do I know which one is to be trusted?</p>
<p>If I publish an hcard on <a href="http://morethanseven.net">my site</a> using the following markup, including a microID using the included email and url details to form the hash.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:a52b4f86cfa4190b53634d99198c0f56970c8d83"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://morethanseven.net" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If the hcard search engine reads that hcard on the morethanseven.net domain it could check the hash in the vcard against doings it&#8217;s own hash with the specified email address and url (checking the url is the same as the one on which the vcard lives). &#8220;Ah ha&#8221;. It can say. This looks like an authoritive hcard.</p>
<p>This does however raise a couple of issues. In order for the search engine or external reader to be able to create its hash you have to include the email in your hcard. I&#8217;m also not sure it does solve the issue of evil me:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:40b46e5c349453bddd0dbd022fb33488494699cb"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;evil gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://spammer.com" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@spammer.com" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the above is published on spammer.com then I&#8217;m sunk. It&#8217;s another authorative hcard with the same name, in this case <em>my</em> name. Of course therein lies another problem, when we name our children we tend to just do it on a whim, we even copy names we like from other people! And we change or subvert these names when we dont like them with nick names and the like. Domain names are unique so we avoid this problem.</p>
<p>So, a possible solution does present itself; using the uniqueness of domain names combined with the fact that most people aren&#8217;t evil spammers. Lets postulate a search engine finds lots of hcards for a given name. Most of these hcards probably point back to the url of the entity they are describing (so most hcards on the web describing me point back to this site). We can then check if one of the hcards is from that domain, and if it has a valid microID. In other words we use the lazy web to identify the most likely location of an authorative hcard.</p>
