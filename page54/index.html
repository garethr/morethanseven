    <p>After the numerous games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ">Werewolf</a> at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a> recently a few of us <a href="http://kid666.com/blog/2007/02/19/werewolf-cards/">got chatting</a> about the idea of custom Werewolf cards using <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Well I&#8217;ve just finished a very simple example of this and thought I&#8217;d post it up.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFlickrwerewolf.jpg" title="Definately a Werewolf" alt="Definately a Werewolf" /></p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf">morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf</a> for a set of printable cards based on Flickr Machine Tags.</p>
<p>In the future I may enhance this with a nifty interface which lets visitors select the number of each card they want &#8211; and I spoke briefly with <a href="http://www.whitelabel.org/">Stefan</a> from <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo</a> about if it&#8217;s possible to link into printing them on those lovely Moo cards.</p>
<p>If you want anyone to appear just add the relevant werewolf machine tag!</p>

        Parsing ERDF

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Now we&#8217;ve got some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/microformats-and-erdf-sitting-in-a-tree/">eRDF in our pages</a> we need to extract it out in preparation for doing someting with it.</p>
<h3>With <span class="caps">XSL</span></h3>
<p>First up we want to try and extract the eRDF in our page into an <span class="caps">RDF</span> document. <a href="http://iandavis.com">Ian Davis</a> has already created a nice <span class="caps">XSL</span> document to do just that. and I&#8217;ve implemented a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/erdf/">nice service wrapper</a> to extract the <span class="caps">RDF</span> from a given <span class="caps">URL</span>. Try pointing it at <a href="http://morethanseven.net">morethanseven.net</a> or <a href="http://iandavis.com">iandavis.com</a> for an example of it in action. Next step here is to extend it to allow extracting a simple vcard from the <span class="caps">RDF</span> in a similar manner to <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian Suda&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">Microformats extractor</a>.</p>
<h3>With Javascript</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan Webb</a> has recently written up his <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/2007/2/9/sumo-a-generic-microformats-parser-for-javascript">Sumo! microformas parser</a> and boy is it really rather fancy. At the moment he&#8217;s only got profiles for hCard, hCalendar and hResume but writing profiles is relatively simple. Accoring to one of Dans comments he&#8217;s working on adding support for rel and rev style microformats like rel-tag and <span class="caps">XFN</span>.</p>
<p>Although billed as a Microformats parser, in reality what Dan&#8217;s created is pretty generic. You can use it to parse out any information marked up with any semantic class names &#8211; just like our eRDF.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a very basic Sumo! profile for <span class="caps">FOAF</span> and some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/foaf/">simple tests to extract eRDF data from a test page</a>. This is very much a proof of concept of extracting eRDF using Javascript but would be relatively simple to extend for the full <span class="caps">FOAF</span> spec once Dan or someone else extends Sumo! to support rel and rev.</p>
<p>On a related note the combination of Sumo! and the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> javascript console is just perfect. Anyone who hasn&#8217;t yet downloaded the latest version should get over there quick.</p>

        Microformats and eRDF sitting in a tree

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Following on from <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/what-erdf-can-learn-from-microformats/">my previous post</a> on <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">eRDF</a> I&#8217;ve started to play around with it. For anyone bored enought to have read the source of this site today you&#8217;ll have seen a couple of behind the scenes changes &#8211; specifically I&#8217;ve added a dash of <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FOAF</span>, or Friend of a Friend, project is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creating a Web of machine-readable pages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sort of see it as a bigger and more complicated older brother to <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn"><span class="caps">XFN</span></a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>.</p>
<p>First things first, unlike <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a>, using eRDF needs a bit of setup outside just adding classes and attributes &#8211; specifically you need to add a profile to the <em>head</em> element of your document and then add some namespaces links into the <em>head</em> like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;head profile="http://purl.org/NET/erdf/profile"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="schema.rdfs" href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="schema.foaf" href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then you&#8217;re onto the more familiar ground (if you&#8217;re used to Microformats) of adding semantic attributes. I already had the following snippet markup up in hCard, i just needed to add a few more classes (-foaf-Person, foaf-weblog and foaf-name) to existing elements.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="iHead"&gt;
  &lt;h2 class="vcard -foaf-Person" id="gareth"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/" class="url org foaf-weblog"&gt;Morethanseven&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;is where &lt;a href="mailto:&amp;#103;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;" 
    class="email fn foaf-name"&gt;Gareth Rushgrove&lt;/a&gt; plays with the web
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The full <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span> Specification</a> details a huge range of other elements &#8211; everything from <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_Project">foaf:Project</a> for making associations between yourself and projects you have worked on, to <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_OnlineGamingAccount">foaf:OnlineGamingAccount</a> which is pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>When parsed out that gives you a foaf document a little something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:admin="http://webns.net/mvcb/" 
  xmlns:doap="http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#"

  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=""&gt;

    &lt;ns_13:weblog xmlns:ns_13="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
      Morethanseven
    &lt;/ns_13:weblog&gt;
    &lt;ns_14:name xmlns:ns_14="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
      Gareth Rushgrove
    &lt;/ns_14:name&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://morethanseven.net"/&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net"/&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So far I&#8217;d agree with <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/fao-rdf/">Ben</a>. All I&#8217;ve done is something people (including me) have been doing already with hCard. But I&#8217;ve done it in a way, using eRDF, that doesn&#8217;t in any way stop me continuing using Microformats.</p>
<p>Marking things up with Microformats for it&#8217;s own sake was only ever really of interest to markup junkies (including me again). It&#8217;s only when you can parse that information out that it gets more interesting. I&#8217;ve got a follow up post to this on just that subject involving some <span class="caps">XSL</span>, Javascript, <span class="caps">PHP</span> and some standing on the shoulder of giants. It will be left to a post after that when I try do something a little different.</p>
<p>On a related note; so far I&#8217;ve found only scattered and often overly technical and verbose documentation on eRDF and <span class="caps">RDF</span> in general. I&#8217;ve been adding links to <a href="http://del.icio.us/garethr">del.icio.us</a> as I find useful resources but I can see how useful <a href="http://getsemantic.com">Get Semantic</a> has the potential to be if any of this is going to take off in the web standards community.</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve posted a list before of events and meetups I know about around the UK but had got playing with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/">Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span></a> and decided to go one stage further and create a hopefully useful place to put all that info in the shape of a quick mashup.</p>
<p>Have a look over on <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/meetup">morethanseven.net/presents/meetup</a> for a hopefully useful tool. I&#8217;ll try and keep this up to date manually for the time being, so if you know of any other get togethers please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add them to the list. Thanks to the excellent, if a little technical (well, it is Google) <span class="caps">API</span> documentation and <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://austin.adactio.com">Adactio Austin</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgMapSample.jpg" title="Sample map of UK Meetups" alt="Sample map of UK Meetups" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to make this even more flexible, ideally all I should have to do is point the page at the group urls and then parse out the geo-coded microformats data and then display it on the map and page, rather than duplicate this information and maintain it by hand. So if any of the owners of these sites want to geo-code up their sites and let me know that would be great. Some <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> integration might be on the cards too.</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be of some use to anyone looking for things going on in their area, or if you find yourself in a strange part of the country for whatever reasons then you&#8217;ll know how to find the local geek community without risking life and limb with an odd T-Shirt.</p>

        What eRDF can learn from Microformats 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2007</span>

    <p>Quite a bit of time at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a> was spent thinking, talking and in running skirmishes about the Semantic Web. Or the semantic web depending which <em>side</em> you&#8217;re on.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m a big fan and perpetual user of <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a>. They make sense, are simple to add everywhere (by stealth if needs be) and the potential is pretty interesting to boot. They are designed in the open, allowing everyone to participate and have a strong emphasis on solving every day problems in the real world.</p>
<p>Contrast that with <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a> and the Semantic Web. Most of the work here has been going on for years in academic institutions and W3C working groups. It&#8217;s all rather grandiose. Everything I&#8217;d seen previously horribly broke <span class="caps">HTML</span>. But someone seems to have seen the light. <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/tommorris/">Tom Morris</a> mentioned in one of his talks <a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml">eRDF</a>, which is a method for embedding <span class="caps">RDF</span> in <em>valid</em> <span class="caps">HTML</span>.</p>
<p>After one of the talks I got chatting with Tom Morris and <a href="http://www.kid666.com/blog/">Tom Croucher</a>, both card carrying <span class="caps">RDF</span> folk, and <a href="http://niquimerret.com/">Niqui Merret</a> another interested bystander. Toms argument basically comes down to Microformats solve the 80% problem, <span class="caps">RDF</span> trys to solve the other 20%. I sort of think the Microformats group would probably agree with that. I also like the idea of creating your own formats off the cuff. I&#8217;ve seen enough to at least have a further look see and hopefully try out a few experiements myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/">Ben Ward</a> had a <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/fao-rdf/">few things to say on the subject</a> which are worth a good read. I agree with the majority of his arguments but coudn&#8217;t resist commenting on at least one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If youâ€™re working with <span class="caps">RDF</span>, show me something new. Donâ€™t just rehash vcard and icalendar into your own format; Iâ€™m not interested</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree. One of the best thinks about Microformats, that draw people (including me) in from the get go, is the unquestionable ease with which you can add <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hcard</a> or <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">xfn</a> and get on with your day. Weeks or months later, after a few feel good projects you&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on the wiki when you come across something in need of structure. And even then you find it&#8217;s a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume">composite</a> of something you&#8217;ve seen before.</p>
<p>Right now I&#8217;d love to find that. A simple example of how to mark up a few very simple examples of eRDF. Hey, if that means contact details and a calendar event then so be it. If all that&#8217;s wrapped up in a lovely shiny green coat of pain with an icon logo so much the better. Until I can experiment with simple I cant do anything else, never mind anything new. So that&#8217;s two posts for the future sorted then.</p>
<p>Tom has set up a wiki over at <a href="http://www.getsemantic.com/wiki/Main_Page">GetSemantic</a> to start to collate information together in one place which from my initial research seems like a good idea. If and when I get enough together (and the <a href="http://openid.net">OpenId</a> authentication is up and running) I&#8217;ll make sure to add everything there. If I get carried away and find interesting voices on the blogosphere I might event get a planet up and running. Or I might find way too much <span class="caps">XML</span> and leave it at that.</p>
