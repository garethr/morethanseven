    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2006</span>

    <p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/03/09/391362.aspx">Chris Wilson</a>, during his <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> presentation mentioned in passing the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D13EE10D-2718-47F1-AA86-1E32D526383D&#38;displaylang=en">IE 7 Readiness Toolkit</a>. This vaguely uninspiring title hides a very nice collection of essential tools for discerning web developers on Windows.</p>
 <p><a href="http://poisonedminds.com/comics/pm20060621.png">IE is painful</a> we already know that. We have a large number of tools available in Firefox to help us out, but sometimes you need to go to the source. Along with a nice <del>rip off</del> <ins>implementation</ins> of a web developer toolbar, it also put me onto <a href="http://www.fiddlertool.com/fiddler/">the Fiddler</a> (what is it about these names) which is an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Debugging proxy. What? Well it sits next to IE and monitors all <span class="caps">HTTP</span> traffic, allowing you to find out exactly what&#8217;s going on. Very handy indeed, and worth running just to see what&#8217;s really going on, especially in Ajax land.</p>
 <p>A couple of other interesting tools are included that I&#8217;ve not had a look at yet, the Expression Finder looks particularly interesting. It basically tracks down any hacks in your files and tells you off.</p>
 <p>All in all a good move from Microsoft. What with <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">Open Search</a> being integrated into IE 7 as well, and <span class="caps">RSS</span> maybe reacing a tipping point eventually (Non geeks will believe my predictions one day) things might be looking up.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jun 2006</span>

    <p>Yes folks. <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media 2006</a> is all over. Except for the year thing, everything else really was doubled. Double the people. Double the speakers. Double the number of chairs (no sitting on the floor this time!)</p>
 <p>I made a list of a couple of things to make sure I did. Well how did I do?</p>
<ul>
 <li>Take photos &#8211; Check. I&#8217;ll upload as I get a chance, but in the meantime their are already quite a few over on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/atmedia/">the atmedia flickr tag</a></li>
  <li>More SubEthaEdit note taking &#8211; With the problems with the wi-fi this was held to a single session on <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/files/events/atmedia-2006/20060615-1400-the-new-accessibility-guidelines-wcag-20.txt"><span class="caps">WCAG</span> 2.0</a> with <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a> and <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk">Ben</a></li>
  <li>Eat food (You know who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about) &#8211; Again score one. Some photos from a nice mexican place on the Thursday with <a href="http://thinkdrastic.net/">Olly</a> and <a href="http://www.liptrot.org">Adam</a></li>
  <li>Keep updating the syndicator thing &#8211; Again wi-fi problems but I did it each night anyhow. 38 new posts over the few days, and I need to add a few more sites. I do keep wondering about just using Technorati anyhow?</li>
  <li>Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup) &#8211; I wont talk about that. Until I switched from drinking Corona to Asashi it was a little dull.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Apart from that I got up to the usual geekery. Met lots of people. Drank a few beers. Went to a few talks and panels.</p>
 <p>I wandered around with a whole host of people. I&#8217;d try and name drop but I&#8217;d miss someone and make them feel bad. Well, ok, probably not but their you go.</p>
 <p>The evening of the first night of the conference was particularly amusing. Wetherspoons for food, a short rant with <a href="http://quirksmode.org"><span class="caps">PPK</span></a> and <a href="http://brothercake.co.uk">James</a> about (what else) Javascript and then spending the evening under the stars with <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>, <a href="http://www.logohere.co.uk/blog/blog.htm">Andy</a> and a few others was, er, entertaining? slightly disturbing? bordering on stalking? All of those and more.</p>
 <p>Their is simply too much to say and too little time. Which sort of explains the lack of details about the sessions and my take on them. I&#8217;ll probably post more about how I think the social side of things really is an integral part of these do&#8217;s, and how <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> really does deserve some sort of medal, and, well, you get the slighty hyper idea. And with my wi-fi hopefully working at home by now keep your readers peeled for both irreverant (sorry &#8211; irrelevant) banter and hopefully a couple of interesting insights and highlights.</p>
 <p>More name dropping next time. Promise. Oh, and leave a comment if I said hi, it&#8217;s always a pleasure guys.</p>

    <p>Right. It might have taken an overlong trip to London but I&#8217;ve finally got a spare moment <em>and</em> internet access. All back to normal hopefully soon. (mmmm)</p>
 <p>Anyway&#8230; <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>! It was ages ago, then some magical time warp type thing happened and it&#8217;s June all of a sudden. And I cant wait. Which is fairly handy as I&#8217;ll shortly be heading out to the pre show party to meet at least some people I know (or at least vaguely recognise from somewhere, once, maybe) and hopefully some new faces, always a solid part of the conferences I think.</p>
 <p>Some of the things I want to do over the next couple of days, besides listen to alot of good stuff. (Rereading this I realised I just refered to Molly, Tantek,  Jeffrey, Eric and everyone as <em>good stuff</em>. This is likely to be something of an understatement. No offence intended!)</p>
<ul>
 <li>Take photos</li>
  <li>More SubEthaEdit note taking</li>
  <li>Eat food (You know who I&#8217;m <a href="http://cackhanded.net">talking</a> <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">about</a>)</li>
  <li>Keep updating the syndicator thing</li>
  <li>Watch the football (sorry, it is the World Cup)</li>
</ul>
 <p>And I&#8217;ve no idea which sessions I&#8217;m going along to before you ask. I&#8217;m still pretending I can go to all of them to avoid the disapointment.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been doing all sorts of stuff I want to blog about; I&#8217;m doing a Masters type usability and testing certificate, playing with more <span class="caps">PEAR</span>, I&#8217;ve been having a play with <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Codeigniter</a> quite a bit as well, which is lovely (thanks <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a>) and have a couple more small apps in the oven. I also want to clean up a couple of olders ones (the mailing list, the feed syndicator, etc.) and still need to get round to writing a proper article. And that&#8217;s before @media, I dont want to thing how busy I&#8217;ll make myself after than once I get even more ideas.</p>
 <p>Oh, and apologies for the <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/ical-schedule-for-media#comment">delay</a> in getting <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">the calendar</a> updated. And I&#8217;ve no idea why some people couldn&#8217;t find it with the search tool. Anyway, updated now, so at least people shouldn&#8217;t get lost tomorrow.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to bare with me at the moment. I&#8217;m busy, moving house, have no internet outside work (except open wi-fi points) and oh, did I mention I&#8217;m busy?</p>
 <p>I have the usual raft of ideas, inability to really finish things unless I try and a dangerous penchant for playing with ever more scripting languages (<a href="http://media.wu-wien.ac.at/">XOTcl</a> anyone?).</p>
 <p>Oh, the friends bit? Inspired by <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and her incredible ability to be open about her life, I thought I&#8217;d say a huge <strong>Thank you</strong> to everyone who helped me move house this week. Much appreciated. It could have gone oh so wrong, but everyone chipping in meant everything worked out just fine.</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 May 2006</span>

    <p>I dont often just post links to things I find interesting. I try and warble on more about something or other that&#8217;s on my mind. However, being rather busy and coming across something that really stood out makes this here post different.</p>
 <p>I stumbled upon <a href="dabbledb.com">DabbleDB</a> the other day. Watched the <a href="http://www.dabbledb.com/utr/">video</a>. Thought to my self &#8220;That&#8217;s pretty darn slick&#8221;.</p>
 <p>DabbleDB is, pretty simply, an online database. For everyone. Ever. The blurb from the site says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Dabble DB combines the best of group spreadsheets, custom databases, and intranet web applications into a new way to manage and share your information on the web</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>What does that mean? It&#8217;s basically MS Access, but better and available through a web browser. Too complicated you say? Too hard to grasp? Watch the video. Be impressed.</p>
 <p>One claim I&#8217;m interested in getting first hand experience of is the one regarding Spreadsheets. Most people use spreadsheets as light weight (ie. flimsy) databases, rather than the number crunching powerhouses they really are. DabbleDB seems an ideal replacement to the former, but what about the latter? I remeber seeing <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/">Dean Edwards&#8217;</a> playing with a <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/base/spreadsheet/">Javascript Spreadsheet</a> a while back.</p>
 <p>I have to say I haven&#8217;t used DabbleDB yet. I haven&#8217;t signed up for a one month trial because I know I wouldn&#8217;t have time to explore properly just now. Everything that I&#8217;m excited about comes from the video, the site and the attached blog. When (not if) I get round to having a proper look I&#8217;ll try and remeber to post something.</p>
 <p>Pretty much all your common desktop apps are <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com/">now</a> <a href="http://www.campfirenow.com/">available</a> <a href="http://www.writely.com">through</a> <a href="http://calendar.google.com">a</a> <a href="http://gmail.com">browser</a>, except crazy things like image editing. Oh and the browser itself. Now their&#8217;s an idea. A meta browser. Within your browser window open up several smaller windows, maybe using different rendering engines or setups running remotely?</p>
