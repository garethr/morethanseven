        Mint goings on

    <span class="post-date">06 Nov 2005</span>

    <p>Well. Lots of goings on since the <a href="http://cssreboot.com">reboot</a>. Rather than fill up lots of posts I thought I&#8217;d summarise &#8211; If something is interesting enough I&#8217;ll probably come back to it.</p>
 <p>Thanks everyone for positive comments about the redesign, lots of new visitors to the site from the reboot site itself and people who liked the design and said so on their sites:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://pixelicious.co.uk/">pixelicious.co.uk</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.net-lounge.de">net-lounge.de</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://brainfuel.tv/">brainfuel.tv</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>I even got onto <a href="http://screenspire.com/view/morethanseven.net/">screenspire</a> which was nice.</p>
 <p>All of this I&#8217;ve had the joy of watching from the vantage point of <a href="http://www.haveamint.com">mint</a>. I mentioned that I&#8217;d installed it a while back, as much to have a play around as anything but as many before me had stated, you can easily get hooked on the stats &#8211; and I&#8217;m enough of a numbers fan as it is. So what follows is a very brief, but real world opinion, of Mint. In case your only interested in the final opinion &#8211; I&#8217;m a fan (you could tell that anyway).</p>
 <p>First things first, purchase, download and installation was an absoolute breeze. OK so I&#8217;m fine with all kinds of command line driven installs but their was non of that anyhow. Just change a simple text configuration file, create a database and upload. Everything else was just point at a <span class="caps">URL</span> and away we go.</p>
 <p>I decided to install a couple of the official peppers (plugins) along the way, again a simple matter of upload, login and click install.</p>
 <p>Login presents the nice interface everyone was googling over. It&#8217;s all nice shades of green, shadows and javascript scrolling. The pane&#8217;s themselves provide information about Visits, Referrers, Pages and Searches. This isn&#8217;t all the information you might be used to from other log file based packages but once you get over that you dont really need anything else under most circumstances.</p>
 <p>One thing that did interest me was information about screen resolutions and that&#8217;s where the User Agent 007 pepper comes in. Displaying information about screen resolution, along with details of Browser and Flash versions. It&#8217;s all very voyeuristic I know but hey.</p>
 <p>The Visits and Referrers panes are probably where most of the action is. The Referrers section is great from my point of view for seeing who is linking to me, really useful for tracking down interesting people I have no other way of finding out about. Visits details lots of information about the number of visits and visitors &#8211; cunningly logged using javascript so as to avoid lots of referrer (ie. spider) spam. Having said that, Google cropped up in my User Agent 007 pane so maybe Google triggers it too?</p>
 <p>So. Is it for you? I get the feeling that it depends. It&#8217;s come out of the blogging scene so to speak and it shows. Design decisions have been made that strengthen it immeasurably for blogs while, in my mind, weaken it for other kinds of sites &#8211; in particular from my past experience for campaign style sites where you really want to look at this sort of detail.</p>
 <p>For example the choice of <span class="caps">PHP</span>, how many well known blogs (at least in the corner of the web inhabited by web designers) dont use <span class="caps">PHP</span>? So for blogs that&#8217;s not a problem but for other sites it can be.</p>
 <p>Another area is the ability to query the statistics. For a blog you just want to know traffic all the time probably. For a campaign you want to know what happened when. And that might mean going back in time so to speak &#8211; when putting together a report for instance. It might be possible to mine this data, even build a pepper around it &#8211; but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s playing to Mints strengths.</p>
 <p>As I said initially, these aren&#8217;t really critisisms. Specialist software is where it&#8217;s at in my mind. And this is definately a very nice piece of software.</p>

    <p>The real <a href="http://www.cssreboot.com"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Reboot</a> should be going off anytime now. But I&#8217;m in Rome (this message is coming at you through the magic of Textpatterns publish on date facility) so had to put things up a <em>little</em> prematurely. Oh well. In fairness I know which one I&#8217;d prefer to be doing.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll miss the initial rush of running through lots of screen shots and sites, finding new things and generally wanting to redo the design at least for a week anyway. When I&#8217;m back I&#8217;ll post a list of one&#8217;s that caught my eye.</p>
 <p>In the meantime a couple of other ongoing bits. I&#8217;ll try and sort out lots of photos onto Flickr when I&#8217;m back, hopefully including some shots from Rome and a few other series I&#8217;ve taken and not got round to. Also after meetups, lots of discussion on and around <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a> hopefully a sense of renewed focus and some hapenings around that.</p>
 <p>All in all I&#8217;m sure I wont be missed, but enjoy the reboot. If you have any personal favourites then leave a comment. If you have opinions about mine then leave those too. Especially if they&#8217;re nice.</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Oct 2005</span>

    <p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong> Well. Five people seemed a good number on the notice and the size of the table we got at the Forth. The trick of leaving a copy of bulletproof web design casually on the side of the table worked a treat.</p>
 <p>Lots of hello&#8217;s, some vague recognition and lots of shared experiences and good ideas floated around. All in all a positive thing I though and hopefully the first of similar meetups in Newcastle.</p>
 <p>Hi to, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.buy.at/">Ben</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mcskiver.com/blog/">Lee</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://coded.uk.com">Kev</a></li>
  <li>Name to be remembered!</li>
</ul>
 <p>The <a href="http://www.accessify.com">accessify</a> forum meetup <del>is tonight</del> <ins>was on Thursday</ins> at the <strong>Forth</strong> for anyone who doesn&#8217;t know about it and is around the area. Looking to be a small number turning up but should hopefully be good to meet new people. I&#8217;ll post more details on here, and any photos (no photos, sorry), post event.</p>
 <p>What do I want out of it besides the beer? Hopefully some ideas and enthusiasm. I keep meaning to do more with <a href="http://www.newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia</a> and a few people have expressed an interest in pulling some things off &#8211; the mailing list even kicked off yesterday with a flurry of posts. So some concrete ideas, a broader network and some beer will do nicely.</p>

    <p>If you want to talk to me about, well anything really, let me know. Your best bet is probably emailing me on <a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net">gareth@morethanseven.net</a> and hopefully I should get back to you. Unless you&#8217;re a spam bot in which case expect to be automatically deleted or ignored.</p>
 <p>On the other hand I can be found wandering the corridors over at <a href="http://www.designersinhouse.com/">designersinhouse.com</a> or appearing in person at anything I can get along to that sounds interesting.</p>

        All change (again)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2005</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m actually going on holiday soon and seem to be getting all sorts done before I go away. The obvious one is the change of scenery around these parts. Let me know what you think. It&#8217;s not complete as yet and I have a few more bits to add and check (yes I mean you IE) but I&#8217;m all for release early and often.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;d been meaning to move on a little recently, and the move to <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> cemented that. I&#8217;m still impressed with it and wanted to delve further into setting up flexible forms and pages. I&#8217;ve set up a few areas of the site to hopefully make me organise things a little better &#8211; specifically an experiments section to play with code and an articles section if I every actually get round to writing something properly. Both appear in the sidebars.</p>
 <p>Another reason for the sudden change was, after using <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/plete/2004/03/shortstat-beta-3">ShortStat</a> for quite a while and looking over the Mint information on the <a href="http://haveamint.com">haveamint.com</a> site I made the plunge. Some had moaned about the cost but really Ã‚Â£17 is the price of a <span class="caps">DVD</span> and with a <span class="caps">DVD</span> you dont get the sense of supporting a really <a href="http://shauninman.com">smart developer</a>. Ok so I could have seemlessly moved from one to the other without a change in the design but I didn&#8217;t want to (confuse my database).</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll hopefully post a review of sorts (better late than never) as the dicussion doesn&#8217;t seem to have died down yet. I&#8217;d personally like to see more of this sort of small, clever, personal application development. I&#8217;ve been a bit Open Source advocate for a good while which has it&#8217;s merits but I&#8217;m still of the mind that something as focused and polished as Mint is more likely to come out of one mind. The question is, I guess, about the market? If you&#8217;re <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/pimp-my-mint">friends</a> <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2005/09/mint-the-flavor-of-the-month">blog</a> to a huge number of other web designers, bloggers and developers then you have an <em>in</em> on the promotional front but will that become the norm rather than a very clever marketing ploy?</p>
 <p>Also on the paying part, lots of people thought $30 was quite steep, I disagreed but will we be back to Shareware and people not paying? Lots of questions. Not many answers yet. But should be interesting to see where things go &#8211; at least for people like me with an interest in the sociology of software.</p>
