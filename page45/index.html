    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>So, while sat with a few people at the WaSP panel at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> (of which more later when I&#8217;m fully caught up) I got a nice email from the folks at <a href="http://2008.xtech.org">Xtech</a> accepting my presentation idea. The abstract is below. If any of that sounds interesting or up your street I&#8217;d love to hear other peoples experiences or ideas on the subject.</p>
<h2>Design Strategies for a Distributed Web</h2>
<h3>From language frameworks to APIs</h3>
<p>Everyone is making use of mature and stable web application or javascript frameworks these days. That means weâ€™ve stopped reinventing things such as routing and object relational mapping, but weâ€™re all still building very similar components again and again. Frameworks might allow us to solve lots of fine grained problems but APIs could let us solve common course grained problems quicker.</p>
<h3>Building blocks for your applications</h3>
<p>Their are already a few examples in the wild of APIs designed to be used as part of your application development process. Amazon has been leading the way in providing remote services such as S3, EC2 and SimpleDB. Their are also options when it comes to hosting these services yourself, the mint analytics software and the CouchDb database service are both good examples.</p>
<h3>Quality engineering for free</h3>
<p>The real value of outsourcing a discreet portion of your application to a third party <span class="caps">API</span> lies in quality. You could always use local storage and your programming language of choice to deal with a large volume of file read and write operations. But do you really think youâ€™ll beat Amazon for reliability, scalability and speed?</p>
<h3>Functionality vs Data</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s not just high quality functionality that we could leverage from other providers. Weâ€™re all fed up with entering and re-entering our personal data into each new service. With advancements like OAuth and Microformats and lots of focus on data portability at the moment we might just be able to share data too.</p>
<h3>Change the client as well as the server</h3>
<p>Sometimes itâ€™s not enough to just change the server. The rise of specialised browsers such as Joost and Songbird allows for functionality that would be impossible otherwise. Site specific browser, along with advancements such as local storage, may prove<br />
Problems</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not all in place just yet. The reliability of your application is likely to be important, and making use of a distributed set of APIs could leave you in the unenviable position of being less stable than your least stable partner. The issue of lock-in could also raise itâ€™s head, without a vibrant ecosystem of different providers that is.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>The use of third party commercial APIs has the potential to change the development landscape â€“ bringing high quality middleware to the web. It could be the original web services dream realised. But without critical mass and an active market it could also be a new achilles heel for successful startups.</p>

        Generating Charts using Google Charts API
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>I had need recently to produce some nice looking charts and immediately turned to the very nice <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Charts <span class="caps">API</span></a>. Just before Christmas <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> had written up <a href="http://24ways.org/2007/tracking-christmas-cheer-with-google-charts">a great introduction</a> on <a href="http://24ways.org">24ways</a> and ever since I&#8217;d been looking for an excuse.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">Chris</a> wrote up a pretty nice approach to <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2008/01/08/generating-charts-from-accessible-data-tables-using-the-google-charts-api/">enhancing well marked up data tables</a> using the Charts <span class="caps">API</span> with a dash of Javascript and I decided to start with that. I made only a couple of changes to this approach based on personal requirements and preferences.</p>
<p>For a table like this:</p>
<table class="tochart">
  <caption>Caption</caption>  
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <th scope="row">Label</th>
    <td>Data</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>I prefer to use the table header element to mark up the table row and the original script relied on these being <em>td</em> elements. A couple of changes to the javascript fixed that. I also decided to display the <em>caption</em> as a title on the resulting graph.</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;table class="tochart"&gt;
  &lt;caption&gt;Caption&lt;/caption&gt;  
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Data&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;th scope="row"&gt;Label&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Data&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The original script only supported the 3D pie charts and in a couple of cases I wanted to generate bar-charts from the data or flat pie-charts. A few modifications later and you can pass a type parameter into the script via a class on the table.</p>
<p>The default if the parameter isn&#8217;t set is the flat pie-chart, which can also be specified via:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>For the 3D pie-chart:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typep3"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The horizontal bar-chart is created with:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebhg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>And finally the vertical bar-chart is set based on:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;table class="tochart typebvg"&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The complete modified version of Chris&#8217; script is below:</p>
<pre><code>(table2graph = function(){

  /* variables */
  var triggerClass = 'tochart';
  var chartClass = 'fromtable';
  var hideClass = 'hidden';
  var chartColor = 'FFCC33';

  var chartType = 'p';
  
  var toTableClass = 'totable';
  var tableClass = 'generatedfromchart';
  /* end variables */

  var tables = document.getElementsByTagName('table');
  var sizeCheck = /\s?size([^\s]+)/;
  var colCheck = /\s?color([^\s]+)/;

    var t = tables[i];
    var c = t.className;

    if(c.indexOf(triggerClass) !== -1){

      size = size ? size[1] : chartSize;
      var col = colCheck.exec(c);
      col = col ? col[1] : chartColor;

        labels.push(ths[j].getElementsByTagName('em')[0].innerHTML.toLowerCase());
        data.push(tds[j].innerHTML);
      };
      var chart = document.createElement('img');
      chart.setAttribute('src',charturl+data.join(',') + '&amp;' + label + labels.join('|'));
      chart.setAttribute('alt',t.getAttribute('summary'));
      chart.className = chartClass;

  /* convert charts to tables */
  var charts = document.getElementsByTagName('img');

    if(charts[i].className.indexOf(toTableClass) !== -1){
      var t = document.createElement('table');
      var tbody = document.createElement('tbody');
      var data = charts[i].getAttribute('src');
      var th,td,tr;
      var values = data.match(/chd=t:([^&amp;]+)&amp;?/)[1];
      var labels = data.match(/chl=([^&amp;]+)&amp;?/)[1];
      var l = labels.split('|');

      t.className = tableClass;
    };

        Thinking Digital
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">24 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m starting to get excited about <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a>. But first a bit of back-story.</p>
<p>I started out making the trip to <a href="http://atmedia2005.co.uk/">@media 2005</a> and since then have been a regular attendee of more conferences than I can shake a stick at. Lets say I caught the conference bug. But most of those have been within the web standards community niche and more recently I&#8217;ve been looking further afield for conference kicks, party due to the eclectic nature of <a href="http://barcamp.org">BarCamp</a> style events. Anyone in that positions inevitably takes a fancy to going along to <a href="http://www.ted.com/"><span class="caps">TED</span></a>. The <em>only</em> problem is the fact it&#8217;s already booked up until 2010, costs $6,000 just to for a standard membership and is invite only.</p>
<p>This year the folks over at <a href="http://codeworks.net">Codeworks</a>, which is a regional body set up to help us North East digital folk develop an industry, are organising their very own full size conference. The <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> events have been running for a number of years and I&#8217;ve spoken a few times on web related bits and pieces. But these are purposely local events mainly for members and tend to crop up at the rate of once a month. <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a> is a full size, 400 person, conference being held in Newcastle between the 21st and 23rd of May this year covering a similar set of wide ranging themes to <span class="caps">TED</span>; technology, design, mobile plus a bit of philosophy and futurism thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>Now this is good for a few reasons. Only one of which is I can see the venue out of my apartment window. Costing only Â£475 and being in the UK would be a couple of other reasons to get excited. As an aside; I&#8217;m helping out as a board member along with the likes of <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com/">Ian Forrester</a> but I&#8217;d gladly pay my way if I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>The real reason for the excitement though is the calibre of some of the speakers. Ray Kurzweil, Greg Dyke, Dan Lyons (a.k.a. Fake Steve Jobs), Matt Locke, Aubrey De Grey and Tara Hunt to name a few I&#8217;m particularly interested in. And remember folks, this is in Newcastle. Which for the few Londoners reading is a couple of hours North of you. On a train with free wifi even.</p>
<p>Now this might not be a web conference but I&#8217;m pretty interested in the take of the likes of Ray Kurzweil on the web and what will happen in the near future. I&#8217;m also interested in the types of people who will make the trip &#8211; which is really the reason for this post. As everyone knows, one of the best parts of any conference is the chance to chat with like-minded (and not so like-minded) folks. So, who fancies coming along?</p>

        Sorry, but the Flickr API isn&#39;t REST
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>After <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org">SemanticCamp</a> me and <a href="http://icepop.org/">Rey</a> popped in to see <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.osmosoft.com/">Osmosoft</a> towers. A good few interesting conversations ensued, including one about the difference between <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/02/19/mashup-or-integration/">mashups and integration</a>. All good fun basically. <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/">Simon</a> also had an <a href="http://simonmcmanus.com/2008/02/21/off-the-shelf-integration-in-enterprises/">interesting take on the topic</a> as well.</p>
<p>What has all this to do with the topic of this post? Well, Simon says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When compared to small RESTful APIs like flickr and twitter&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not really picking on Simon here, more that I&#8217;ve been meaning to write something on this topic for a while and this proved a good catalyst for a little rant.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/"><span class="caps">API</span></a> is pretty darn cool. But it&#8217;s not RESTful in pretty much any way you want to shake a stick at it. It&#8217;s a well designed <span class="caps">RPC</span> (remote procedure call) <span class="caps">API</span>. Now even flickr get this wrong. They even have <a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/response.rest.html">a page</a> which confuses the issue and makes <span class="caps">REST</span> out to be a response format based on <span class="caps">XML</span>. Bad flickr.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/request.rest.html">flickr states</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">REST</span> Endpoint <span class="caps">URL</span> is http://api.flickr.com/services/rest/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This turns out to be completely against the whole RESTful principles. Lets try and explain. You can define most of what you want to do with an <span class="caps">API</span> with the use of nouns, verbs and content types. <span class="caps">REST</span> is based around limiting the set of verbs to those available in <span class="caps">HTTP</span>; for instance <span class="caps">GET</span>, <span class="caps">POST</span>, <span class="caps">PUT</span> and <span class="caps">DELETE</span>. For any given application or <span class="caps">API</span> you&#8217;ll also specify a set of content types (representations); for instance <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">JSON</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>. All you get to play around with are the nouns, in the case of the web these are our URLs.</p>
<p>In a typical <span class="caps">RPC</span> style <span class="caps">API</span> you have one <span class="caps">URL</span> (like flickr does) which acts as the end point to which all calls are made. You then probably define a few functions which you can call. Lets look at a simple book example.</p>
<pre><code>getBook()
deleteBook()
createBook()
editBook()</code></pre>
<p>The RESTful way of designing this might look a little bit more like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET     /books/{book-id}
DELETE  /books/{book-id}
POST    /books
PUT     /books/{book-id}</code></pre>
<p>We mentioned content types or representations earlier. Lets say instead of the default response format we might want to get a <span class="caps">JSON</span> representation of a given book we might do something like the following.</p>
<pre><code>GET /books/{book-id}.json</code></pre>
<p>The advantages of using URLs as the <span class="caps">API</span> nouns in this way include more than just sane URLs for the site or application in question. The web is based around many of these architectural principles and that seemed to scale pretty well. The idea is that fell envisaged RESTful applications have an advantage here too. For me one of the real benefits of RESTful APIs are in the simplicity they bring to documentation. I already know the available verbs, all I need to know are the set of resource URLs and I can probably use <span class="caps">CURL</span> to work out the <span class="caps">REST</span> (sorry, bad pun).</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is pretty common. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">WikiPedia</a> appreciates their is a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between the uses of the term â€œRESTâ€ causes some confusion in technical discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just pedantry on my part, well not quite. I&#8217;d recommend anyone involved in designing and architecting web sites read <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260">RESTful Web Services</a> as well as <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/">Roy Fielding&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a>. But if you just want to <em>get</em> the general principles and don&#8217;t fancy wading through technical documents then you have to read <a href="http://tomayko.com/articles/2004/12/12/rest-to-my-wife">How I Explained <span class="caps">REST</span> to My Wife</a> hilariously written by <a href="http://tomayko.com/">Ryan Tomayko</a>.</p>
<p>And remember, just because an <span class="caps">API</span> makes use of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> doesn&#8217;t make it RESTful. I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2008</span>

    <p>I had a great time at <a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org/">SemanticCamp</a> over the weekend which was not too much of a surprise. What was a surprise was getting back home to find out that I&#8217;ve been invited to join the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a> (WaSP) on the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/action/edutf">Education Task Force</a>. I even have my <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/grushgrove/">own page</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for inviting me guys. Anyone who has had the misfortune of having me present during a discussion of the current state of web education knows it&#8217;s one of my favourite subjects. Hopefully I can make myself useful around the place and help with getting a few things done. More on this when I know more but in the meantime feel free to pester me endlessly if you have a particular axe to grind.</p>
