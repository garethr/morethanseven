        Things to entertain us in 2008 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>This being a blog and it being the start of a new year (2008 for those not following closely) I feel obliged to list of few predictions of sorts. Rather than concrete <em>this will happen</em> things here are a few bits and pieces I think will be interesting over the next year.</p>
<h2>Site Specific Browsers</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/01/04/a-vision-of-the-web-in-2008/">few</a> <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/12/28/fluid-prism-mozpad-and-site-specific-browsers/">people</a> have already waxed lyrical about Site Specific Browsers and after trying out &#8220;Prism&#8221;:<a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> for a few weeks I can say I really like the idea. Their are a couple of teething problems, both with the idea and the current implementations, but all seem solvable with a little focus. Security (sandbox everything), memory footprint (as small as possible) and integration with the desktop (local storage, <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>?).</p>
<p>I think their are already a couple of extreme examples of this idea in the wild, both of which I&#8217;m already pretty interested in. <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> are doing some pretty cool things with their bespoke application and web site backend and <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> just hit version 0.4 and is looking pretty nice.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll see more and more people playing with mobile apps next year I&#8217;m thinking. Mobile browsers (special mentions to <a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a> and Mobile Safari here) are getting better and better and the iPhone (at least in the UK) has hopefully started something with regards fixed cost unlimited data. With some good <a href="http://mobilewebbook.com/">materials</a> already in print, next years <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> likely to be bigger and better than before and half the web developers I know pondering how they get to work with mobile I see more cool stuff happening here.</p>
<h2>The Backend</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Chris</a> has made a <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2007/12/30/lets-make-2008-the-year-of-embracing-the-server-side-with-ajax">call to arms</a><br />
 (of sorts) and I&#8217;m hoping this comes to pass. It&#8217;s becoming more and more apparent that the best teams are agile and multi-disciplinary and both sides of this divide have lots to gain from each other. For starters most front end people could probably do with learning some good old fashioned software engineering stuff; build tools, source control, deployment, testing, etc. As for the backend guys; how about unobtrusive applications, accessibility and the importance of good quality markup? Apologies for the huge generalisations here, but hopefully you know what I&#8217;m getting at.</p>
<h2>Software as Infrastructure</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.gardeviance.org/">Simon Wardley</a> and others have been talking about software systems as infrastructure for a good while and I think we&#8217;ve seen glimpses of this in the last year. Whether it&#8217;s people using <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> for interesting projects (<a href="http://foamee.com">Foamee</a> for instance) or Amazon and their web service platform (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342335011">SimpleDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342429011">DevPay</a>) we have a start. I think we&#8217;ll see lots more of this sort of drop in web based software over the next year. The key seems to be thinking about things in a RESTful manner, and throwing in as much publicly exposed <span class="caps">JSON</span>, <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Microformats as possible. It will also be interesting to see if the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> takes off next year too.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Education is coming up more and more in conversation between people involved in web design and development it seams, both off and <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/help.php">online</a>. I had a great conversation with <a href="http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel</a> and <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk">Mike</a> after @media and then another good discussion with Dan Dixon, <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://kid666.com/">Tom</a> and others at barcamp and know other smart people are thinking about this too. I&#8217;m hoping to get something off the group here in the next month or so but would love to know about any other industry driven initiatives anyone might know about?</p>
<p>Ok, so that&#8217;s more a list of things I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ll end up focusing on (as much as I ever focus on anything) over the next year. We&#8217;ll see how that goes and if other things crop up that are more interesting. What about you? Anything you think is going to be play worthy next year?</p>

        Nice bits of symfony: Web Debug Toolbar
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/getting-going-with-symfony/">mentioned previously</a> that I&#8217;d been playing with the <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony</a> framework on a couple of projects and I have to admit to being more and more impressed as I wade in looking for things. I&#8217;ve worked with enough <span class="caps">MVC</span>-like frameworks to know they are all quite similar in more ways than they are dramatically different. So it&#8217;s the little bits and pieces that win you over.</p>
<p>One of my favourite little bits in symfony has to be the Web Debug Toolbar. When running in development mode you get a little menu floating above your application like so (top right hand corner).</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgSymfonyToolbar.png" title="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar in the top right corner" alt="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar in the top right corner" /></p>
<p>This gives you all sorts of useful information as you&#8217;re developing your application &#8211; from the number of database queries to the rendering time, with a full logger built in. It&#8217;s also been particularly useful in learning symfony &#8211; being able to follow the entire request through the stack from the logger is really handy when you don&#8217;t know what is going on.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgSymfonyToolbar2.png" title="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar fully expanded" alt="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar fully expanded" /></p>
<p>With the increasing use of object relational mapping in web frameworks it&#8217;s quite easy to end up with a <em>working</em> application on your development box that turns out to absolutely hammer your database when used in the real world by only a few hundred people (I&#8217;m looking at you tagging). The database utilities, showing the number of queries and the <span class="caps">SQL</span> for those queries, is particularly handy for finding bottlenecks here.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgSymfonySQL.png" title="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar SQL view" alt="Web page showing the symfony web debug toolbar SQL view" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not come across something similar in other frameworks, <span class="caps">PHP</span> or otherwise. I&#8217;d be interested to know if similar things do exist for Rails or Django in particular.</p>

        Happy with my eeepc

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>I like small. I have a macbook rather than a macbook pro because it&#8217;s smaller. Especially now I&#8217;m wandering about more often with work (and play) lugging a machine around is less and less appealing. So, armed with that excuse I felt justified in going out and buying a new <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com">Asus Eee PC</a>. I managed to just walk in to <a href="www.microanvika.com/">Micro Anvika</a> in Newcastle and buy one from a bemused staff member who  was pretty shocked to find one in stock and not allocated (sorry <a href="http://www.reyhan.org/">Rey</a>).</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen one before, the Eee PC is a tiny linux laptop a little like the One Laptop Per Child machine but aimed more at traditional computer users (at the moment read <em>early adopting geeks</em>). The distro is setup to be pretty user friendly for those pesky Windows users but a little hacking turns it into a pretty darn nice machine.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEeepcApple.jpg" title="My new eeepc with an apple logo on the back" alt="My new eeepc with an apple logo on the back" /></p>
<p>And yes, I have stuck an apple sticker on back. I&#8217;m sure that should get some entertained looks next time I&#8217;m at a relevant event! I think the machine itself is actually pretty good looking, but the default desktop themes are all pretty uninspiring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve stuck with the appliance like IceWM window manager and the launcher application as it makes starting things up from the keyboard with one hand pretty fast. I then jumped into various hidden away files to get the desktop setup how I like. The <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com">wiki</a> over on <a href="http://eeeuser.com">eee user</a> has a number of useful tutorials; <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:customizeeasymode">customising easy mode</a> and the debian repo from <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:installruby">a ruby tutorial</a> were particularly handy.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEeepcDesktop.jpg" title="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" alt="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" /></p>
<p>Still lots more I could install (this is Linux after all) but so far have installed Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Erlang, MySQL, SQLite, Apache2, PHP5, <span class="caps">PEAR</span> and symfony all without a hitch. I do love apt when it just works. I&#8217;ll try and get Mono and Java on their as well just for completeness when I get a moment.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that I&#8217;ll really miss at the moment is Keynote. It has a <span class="caps">VGA</span> out port (which not even the macbook has) which will support a decent resolution for presentations. But Keynote is so pretty and easy to use compared to the alternatives. We&#8217;ll have to see next time I have to do a presentation.</p>
<p>I can see lots of places (past the obsessive tech geeks like me) where a machine like this will be really interesting. Obviously the low cost of the machine means that schools might just get interested in Linux. For people who prefer a desktop machine as their main computer and only occasionally need a laptop it&#8217;s a pretty cost effective option. As a machine to experiment with Linux it&#8217;s pretty useful too &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend being familiar with basic commands on Linux to anyone doing web development work for instance. With so many possible audiences, and what is already a pretty nice machine, Asus might be onto something here.</p>

        CSS Uprising
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Dec 2007</span>

    <p>For those not following along closely I thought it worth highlighting some interesting goings on around the web. <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> put the <span class="caps">CSS</span> cat amongst the W3C pigeons with a couple of posts; <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/css_unworking_group/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Unworking Group</a> and a following up <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/more/csswg_proposals/"><span class="caps">CSSWG</span> Proposals</a></p>
<p>How I&#8217;ve had a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/css-snapshots-css3-modules-and-an-agile-way-forward/">few ideas</a> myself previously around what I&#8217;d like to see from the CSS3 working group. I&#8217;m now avidly following along with <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/malarkey/comments/csswg_proposals/">the comments</a> and I&#8217;d urge anyone working even on an occasional basis with <span class="caps">CSS</span> to do the same.</p>
<p><a href="http://webkit.org/blog/">Maciej Stachowiak</a> said a few very interesting things in the comments I thought worth commenting on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being an expert user is not necessarily enough to know how to extend it. A key part of extending a technology is knowing how it works on the inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think their-in lies an opportunity. The weight of comments on this issue, and the heat of the argument, would suggest people are interested. But I think a-lot of those interested parties are those working day-in with <span class="caps">CSS</span> (rather than on it) and lack this critical information. As a web designer how do I find this information out? Who are the interesting bloggers in the area of standardisation? Is their are good reference site? Or a wiki? Or an active friendly mailing list of people willing to answer simple questions? The web (standards) design community is used to open discussion and debate &#8211; whether from blogs or projects like <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a>.</p>
<p>You could of course also argue that <em>being an expert implementer is not necessarily enough to know what needs extending. A key part of extending a technology is knowing what is needed first in the real world</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the cost of a serious mistake in a standard is much higher than the cost of an implementation bug.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this depends on the software in question &#8211; what about critical military systems, satellites or space shuttles, power stations, etc. &#8211; but I agree in principle. Most web designers do not have the experience of working on this sort of software project. But then Andy is not putting himself up as a project management guru.</p>
<p>Their are obviously strong feelings on both sides of this debate. But something I would be interested to hear &#8211; from someone with a standards focus &#8211; is whether you think their is a fundamental problem at the moment with regards <span class="caps">CSS</span>? If not then why not? If so then what are your ideas for moving forward?</p>
<p>And feel free to say you don&#8217;t know yet. I think what Andy has done is put down his ideas. If you don&#8217;t like them then suggest better ones. If that&#8217;s sticking to the status quo then say why you it feel will work out.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve posted the above in the comments to the original post, but wanted to repeat it here more in the hope of getting more interested people involved in that thread.)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really expect Andy to have the answers to this issue, but by him kicking the discussion off in such a public way the least we can <em>all</em> do is have the debate we need and come up with the solutions for everyone. Especially on the  list of <em>getting started with standards</em> links and reading materials alluded to above, if someone has this information but not the time to get it online in a coherent fashion, or to present it to the wider community then please get in touch.</p>
