        A few interesting upcoming events
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>After a break over Christmas the web world is back in full swing with a few upcoming events.</p>
<p><a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampScotland2008">BarCamp Scotland</a> &#8211; <em>February 2nd</em>.</p>
<p>I only just found out about this one but it looks like a few people from Refresh Newcastle and Refresh Edinburgh are going to make it along. The short notice does mean I have to think of something to talk about sharpish though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thinkandadrink.com/">Think and a Drink</a> &#8211; <em>February 7th</em></p>
<p>Bit of shameless self promotion here. I&#8217;m speaking at the monthly <a href="http://www.codeworks.net/">Codeworks</a> get together on something to do with the Web. Also speaking is <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/">Paul Downey</a> from BT and another regular BarCamp attendee. If you&#8217;re around Newcastle try and get along (it&#8217;s a membership event but let me know if you want to go along and I&#8217;ll speak with the organisers).</p>
<p><a href="http://semanticcamp.tommorris.org/">Semantic Camp</a> &#8211; <em>February 16th &#8211; 17th</em></p>
<p>A whole BarCamp style event brought to you by <a href="http://tommorris.org">tommorris</a>. This looks likely to be particularly interesting event I think.</p>
<p><a href="http://futureofwebdesign.com/">Future of Web Design</a> &#8211; <em>April 17th &#8211; 18th</em></p>
<p><em>The Future of&#8230;</em> rolls into town again, this time with a focus on web design. I&#8217;d be tempted to go along to this solely for the Photoshop tennis doubles match with <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> commentating. The rest of the content looks pretty good to.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk">Thinking Digital</a> &#8211; <em>May 21st &#8211; 23rd</em></p>
<p>Another event I&#8217;m involved in, this time on the board along with <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com">Ian Forrester</a> from The <span class="caps">BBC</span> and Mike Butcher from <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a>. This one is a little different to most of the events I go along to &#8211; being less web centric and more about all sorts of interesting ideas. With the likes of <a href="http://horsepigcow.com/">Tara Hunt</a>, Sean Phelan (<a href="http://www.multimap.com/">MultiMap</a>), <a href="http://www.test.org.uk/">Matt Locke</a> and <a href="http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/">Dan Lyons</a> (a.k.a. Fake Steve Jobs) speaking it should be good fun. Oh, and did I mention it&#8217;s in Newcastle?</p>
<p>And look, only two of those are in London!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already looking like 2008 will be even more jam packed than last year. I also have a sneaking feeling that their will be lots more events <em>Up North</em> this year than last. It will be interesting to see how this works out. Will more people come along that might not have travelled down to London? Will the event happy northerners still go to London as well? Will anyone from London travel north of Watford? Time will tell.</p>

      <a href="/2008/01/13/on-process-and-design/">
        On Process and Design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>I consider myself something of a hybrid, flirting with both the design and development side of things. I also like to think of myself as something of a student of the discipline; reading and consuming as much knowledge as possible on the process as well as the practice. Something I took to pondering while reading <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to India</a> was why the majority of theory books tend to be from the software side?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s appears the same when it comes to discussions of process, and in turn innovation within process. Their is lots of talk around Agile processes and practices amongst software developers, but I don&#8217;t see lots of designers discussing the how. User Centred Design is maybe a slight exception, but again it seems to be the software people and information architects, as apposed to those who consider themselves designers, who talk about this. I&#8217;m just wondering whether others have found this too?</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk">Design Council</a> published a pretty good resource <a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/en/About-Design/">About Design</a> but I haven&#8217;t seen much other real literature on a modern design process. <a href="http://www.communicatingdesign.com/">Communicating Design</a> is a fantastic book on design documentation, but doesn&#8217;t frame this in terms of a discussion of process. If anyone knows of any books or blogs out their on the subject I&#8217;d love to know about them. I&#8217;d love to be proved wrong and end up with a good reading list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti">My Job Went to India</a> (which is excellent by the way) contains 52 hints and tips for your career as a programmer. In reality most of these ideas apply to any creative discipline, only the examples and analogies need changing. You could probably argue the same for books like <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pad">Practices of an Agile Developer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware">Peopleware</a>. I&#8217;m also thinking whether or things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">the mythical man month</a> apply? Or if other <em>truths</em> of the design practice exist?</p>
<p>The importance of design in any discipline is becoming increasingly well recognised. But where will the next generation of managers learn about how to manage designers and the design process? One of the problems with front end web development and design work has been the difficulty of learning the craft. Is this the same for managing the web design process?</p>

      <a href="/2008/01/07/how-to-deploy-php-sites-with-the-pake-build-tool/">
        How to deploy PHP sites with the Pake build tool
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>So in case you hadn&#8217;t guessed project automation is the new black. I&#8217;ve been getting back into some development work recently with <a href="http://isitbirthday.com">Is it Birthday?</a> and <a href="http://getjobsin.com">getjobsin</a> and trying to automate as much of the repetitive and boring work as possible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not absolutely sure that that many people outside large or particularly organised teams realise that large web sites are not generally <em>deployed</em> by someone with an <span class="caps">FTP</span> client and crossed fingers. This sort of effort, along with other repetitive tasks like running tests or generating documentation, can be automated. This is a win-win for everyone. It&#8217;s more reliable (scripts don&#8217;t forget to restart a service before they go home), quicker and removes the need for having one person in charge of deployments.</p>
<p>Even where people know about this build process idea they might not use it for their projects, probably for similar reasons why not everyone uses source control. I think the reason is probably that most web designers and developers (even particularly geeky ones) thing this software engineering stuff is maybe a step too far. Their is also something of a barrier to entry, knowing where to look and how to get started without reading lots of documentation (often filled with <span class="caps">XML</span> examples) and trial and error. Also project automation is apparently not sexy?</p>
<p>Anyway, if you&#8217;ve been working with Rails you will have come across <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>, which is a build tool used to automate various tasks. Well the nice <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony</a> people have written a <span class="caps">PHP</span> version called <a href="http://www.pake-project.com/">Pake</a> for use as part of the framework. It&#8217;s used for all the command line action, from running tests to clearing the cache and <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/16-Application-Management-Tools#Using%20rsync%20for%20Incremental%20File%20Transfer">automating deployments</a>. Pake is however a separate tool that you can use in your own projects, whatever framework or hand rolled codebase you are using.</p>
<p>Pake can be downloaded using <a href="http://pear.php.net"><span class="caps">PEAR</span></a> on the command line:</p>
<pre><code>pear upgrade PEAR
pear channel-discover pear.symfony-project.com
pear install symfony/pake</code></pre>
<p>The documentation for Pake is pretty much non-existent as far as I can tell, but it is a really handy tool so worth a little effort. The best source of knowledge is to look through the default Pake tasks that are provided as part of symfony. One of my favourites, which we&#8217;ll look at now, allows for incremental deployments via Rsync over <span class="caps">SSH</span>. I&#8217;ve been using this with non-symfony projects too.</p>
<p>Rsync is a command line tool for syncronising two file structures. The Rsync command that does most of the heavy lifting for the deployment looks like the following. Note I&#8217;ve used {} to denote placeholders in the following examples.</p>
<pre><code>rsync --progress --azC --force \
--delete -e ssh ./ {user}@{host}:{dir}</code></pre>
<p>The sync task I&#8217;m using is straight from symfony, but the licence allows for distribution so here is an <a href="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/downloads/pake/pake.zip">example zip of all the files needed to follow along</a>. You&#8217;ll need these to follow along as I haven&#8217;t printed the full sourcecode for the pakefile here.</p>
<p>First a little configuration. Using <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> we define an environment, <em>staging</em> in this case_ and specify a host, port, user and the full path on the remote server. You can of course specify multiple environments in this file, we&#8217;ll see how to use them shortly.</p>
<pre><code>[staging]
  host={host}
  port=22
  user={user}
  dir={dir}</code></pre>
<p>You can also include an <em>rsync_exclude.txt</em> or an <em>rsync_include.txt</em> file. This gives you control over the files being synced when you run the Pake task. The following example is a good starting point, it stops you pushing those pesky .DS_Store files that <span class="caps">OSX</span> creates to you web server, as well as avoiding subversion metadata and the configuration files for the Pake task.</p>
<pre><code>.svn
.DS_Store
/config/properties.ini
/config/rsync_exclude.txt
/config/rsync_include.txt
/config/rsync.txt</code></pre>
<p>We can now run the following command, from the directory containing the pakefile.php script, using Pake. The first example will do a dry run, showing you what will happen. You&#8217;ll be prompted for your <span class="caps">SSH</span> password as part of the command unless you&#8217;re using keys for authentication.</p>
<pre><code>pake sync staging</code></pre>
<p>When you&#8217;re happy you can run the sync command with the go option which will instruct Rsync to do it&#8217;s thing.</p>
<pre><code>pake sync staging go</code></pre>
<p>Pake has a handy flag to find out what tasks are available.</p>
<pre><code>pake -T</code></pre>
<p>This should give you a list of tasks and a brief description, useful to find out what you can do if you&#8217;ve been away from a project for a while.</p>
<p>This is a pretty simple example but one I&#8217;m already finding useful. Rsync is but one way of deploying apps but with Pake has the advantage of being simple and in lots of situations good enough. It&#8217;s certainly better than a manual deployment process. It would be simple enough to build into the task a simple logging system so you have a log of all deployments; when they happened and who did them for instance.</p>
<p>If that has whet your appetite then their are other deployment tools you might want to look into; <a href="http://www.capify.org/">Capistrano</a> (Ruby), <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> (Java), <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> (Java) and <a href="http://phing.info">Phing</a> (<span class="caps">PHP</span>) spring to mind. If anyone knows of a Python equivalent that would be useful too? I&#8217;m also using Phing for a few tasks on projects at the moment, mainly for some nifty Subversion tasks (and you can use Phing with Pake as symfony does), but that will have to wait until another post.</p>
<p>So, what are peoples experiences of build tools? Any good pointers? Or maybe reasons why you don&#8217;t use them in your projects?</p>

        Things to entertain us in 2008 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Jan 2008</span>

    <p>This being a blog and it being the start of a new year (2008 for those not following closely) I feel obliged to list of few predictions of sorts. Rather than concrete <em>this will happen</em> things here are a few bits and pieces I think will be interesting over the next year.</p>
<h2>Site Specific Browsers</h2>
<p>A <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2008/01/04/a-vision-of-the-web-in-2008/">few</a> <a href="http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/12/28/fluid-prism-mozpad-and-site-specific-browsers/">people</a> have already waxed lyrical about Site Specific Browsers and after trying out &#8220;Prism&#8221;:<a href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/">Prism</a> for a few weeks I can say I really like the idea. Their are a couple of teething problems, both with the idea and the current implementations, but all seem solvable with a little focus. Security (sandbox everything), memory footprint (as small as possible) and integration with the desktop (local storage, <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a>?).</p>
<p>I think their are already a couple of extreme examples of this idea in the wild, both of which I&#8217;m already pretty interested in. <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> are doing some pretty cool things with their bespoke application and web site backend and <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> just hit version 0.4 and is looking pretty nice.</p>
<h2>Mobile</h2>
<p>We&#8217;ll see more and more people playing with mobile apps next year I&#8217;m thinking. Mobile browsers (special mentions to <a href="http://www.operamini.com/">Opera Mini</a> and Mobile Safari here) are getting better and better and the iPhone (at least in the UK) has hopefully started something with regards fixed cost unlimited data. With some good <a href="http://mobilewebbook.com/">materials</a> already in print, next years <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> likely to be bigger and better than before and half the web developers I know pondering how they get to work with mobile I see more cool stuff happening here.</p>
<h2>The Backend</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Chris</a> has made a <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/2007/12/30/lets-make-2008-the-year-of-embracing-the-server-side-with-ajax">call to arms</a><br />
 (of sorts) and I&#8217;m hoping this comes to pass. It&#8217;s becoming more and more apparent that the best teams are agile and multi-disciplinary and both sides of this divide have lots to gain from each other. For starters most front end people could probably do with learning some good old fashioned software engineering stuff; build tools, source control, deployment, testing, etc. As for the backend guys; how about unobtrusive applications, accessibility and the importance of good quality markup? Apologies for the huge generalisations here, but hopefully you know what I&#8217;m getting at.</p>
<h2>Software as Infrastructure</h2>
<p><a href="http://blog.gardeviance.org/">Simon Wardley</a> and others have been talking about software systems as infrastructure for a good while and I think we&#8217;ve seen glimpses of this in the last year. Whether it&#8217;s people using <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> for interesting projects (<a href="http://foamee.com">Foamee</a> for instance) or Amazon and their web service platform (<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2">EC2</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342335011">SimpleDB</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=342429011">DevPay</a>) we have a start. I think we&#8217;ll see lots more of this sort of drop in web based software over the next year. The key seems to be thinking about things in a RESTful manner, and throwing in as much publicly exposed <span class="caps">JSON</span>, <span class="caps">RSS</span> and Microformats as possible. It will also be interesting to see if the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/draft-ietf-atompub-protocol-09.html">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> takes off next year too.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>Education is coming up more and more in conversation between people involved in web design and development it seams, both off and <a href="http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/help.php">online</a>. I had a great conversation with <a href="http://www.rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel</a> and <a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk">Mike</a> after @media and then another good discussion with Dan Dixon, <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://kid666.com/">Tom</a> and others at barcamp and know other smart people are thinking about this too. I&#8217;m hoping to get something off the group here in the next month or so but would love to know about any other industry driven initiatives anyone might know about?</p>
<p>Ok, so that&#8217;s more a list of things I <em>think</em> I&#8217;ll end up focusing on (as much as I ever focus on anything) over the next year. We&#8217;ll see how that goes and if other things crop up that are more interesting. What about you? Anything you think is going to be play worthy next year?</p>
