        CSS Snapshots, CSS3 Modules and an Agile Way Forward
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>The state of <span class="caps">CSS</span> has been a common topic of conversation this year. Ever since <a href="http://www.andybudd.com">Andy Budd</a> stirred things up at <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">The Highland Fling</a> about <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/sessions/the-future-of-css/">The Future of <span class="caps">CSS</span></a> and followed up with a <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/">call for <span class="caps">CSS</span> 2.2</a> we&#8217;ve been wanting more.</p>
<p>Well, in response to all this the CSS3 working group have released <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-beijing/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Snapshot 2007</a> as a working draft. CSS3, in theory, has a modular structure. The idea behind this was that individual pieces could be worked up, specified and released without having to work on the whole thing at once. Sounds a lot like iterative development to me. The problem is we haven&#8217;t, until now, had a stable <em>release one</em> of CSS3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the time this specification enters Candidate Recommendation, Cascading Style Sheets (<span class="caps">CSS</span>) is defined by the following specifications:<br />
* <span class="caps">CSS</span> Level 2 Revision 1 (including errata)<br />
* Selectors Level 3<br />
* <span class="caps">CSS</span> Namespaces<br />
* <span class="caps">CSS</span> Color Level 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So (at least when this document reaches Candidate Recommendation at some unknown point in the future), we can get on and use all those selectors we keep eyeing up. Colors and Namespaces are not particularly interesting, at least to me, but useful non-the-less. CSS2.1 is important as a baseline going forward, especially for the browser makers, rather than being particular interesting for the jobbing web designer.</p>
<p>The problems come when we look at some of the features we want, and the modules they are part of. Andy specifically references <a href="http://andybudd.com/archives/2007/10/snapshot_2007_i/">text-shadow</a> as something that&#8217;s already got more than two sample implementations but is part of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/">Text module</a> which we won&#8217;t see for a while due to it&#8217;s complexity. (As a side note text-shadow was formerly part of CSS2.1 but got dropped due to lack of implementations at the time.) <a href="http://my.opera.com/dstorey/blog/">Dave Storey</a> summed this problem up nicely over on <a href="http://www.css3.info/css-snapshot-2007-released-as-a-working-draft/#comment-59776">CSS3.info</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess this is due to not wanting to put partial parts of a module in this snapshot. Iâ€™d like to see another snapshot draft in around six months that includes full or partial modules that have progressed since the time this snapshot was published.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From a quick look at the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work">current work</a> of the <span class="caps">CSS</span> working group I count six modules at candidate recommendations, six at last call, twenty three at working draft and six not yet started. If modules really are discrete blocks then this to me looks like a recipe for disaster. If modules aren&#8217;t discrete blocks then why are they divided into modules? Rather than focus on shipping modules it appears that the effort of the working group has been spread out across nearly the whole spectrum of CSS3. This pretty much invalidates the idea of a modular approach.</p>
<p>CSS3 is a big project. And specification, like software, is hard. In well organised and managed agile software teams it&#8217;s common to split things down into features, or groups of features (modules). The <span class="caps">CSS</span> working group did this. In a well managed agile team shipping something early is hugely important. Everyone focuses on that goal, rather than on their favorite part of the project that might not be needed until later on. The <span class="caps">CSS</span> working group definitely didn&#8217;t do that. But it&#8217;s what I think is needed now.</p>
<p>The working group are now <a href="http://xhtml.com/en/css/conversation-with-css-3-team/">starting to talk</a> more openly about what they are up to. And the <a href="http://csseleven.com/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Eleven</a> are looking to add some support from a web design industry point of view. I&#8217;m interested to see what they come up with as suggestions and support. The problem I see is that, unless the working group back down on the strict nature of the modules and define sub-modules or simply go to specifying features then we could hit an impasse. The best course of action (from a complete outsider anyhow) would be to get all the people from the working group and from the <span class="caps">CSS</span> Eleven working on one module at a time. Only once a little momentum has been built up maybe they could work on more than one at once, just not thirty five this time. All of that would take some hefty project management and some setting aside personal and organisational politics to get done. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>I actually think things are looking up, but time is certainly a factor here. Lets assume IE.next is released late next year or the start of 2009 (wild speculation). If the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/">Internet Explorer team</a> implement to the current specs at that time &#8211; that could easily not include <span class="caps">CSS</span> Snapshot 2008, which would be reaching candidate recommendation around about the same time as they ship. Which could in theory mean it&#8217;s four years or more before we see text-shadow well supported. Never mind elements of CSS3 which currently have no reference implementations at all! Anyone else with any bright idea? Or insider info that you want to share?</p>

        BBC Innovation Labs 2008
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Oct 2007</span>

    <p>Fab. It&#8217;s that time of year again. Time to start thinking &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if&#8221; when it comes to the <span class="caps">BBC</span> (even if it&#8217;s not your <a href="http://www.cubicgarden.com">day</a> <a href="http://www.thelondonbiker.com/blog/">job</a>).</p>
<p>I had the fortune of going along to this years <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Innovation labs</a> back in March and they&#8217;re back on the road again next year, with <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/2008_how_to_apply.php">applications</a> open from the 1st of December.</p>
<p>The basic concept is simple. Through a simple but competitive process of ideas submission the <span class="caps">BBC</span> find a handful of companies to dump in nice settings in the middle of nowhere for a week to work on their ideas. They are running four labs this year; in Wales and West Midlands, North East England, North West England and Scotland. If you live in any of these areas I&#8217;d strongly recommend finding out more at one of the local events.</p>
<p>Been couped up in a stately home or nice hotel with other <del>odd</del> <ins>nice</ins> people is great fun. It&#8217;s all pretty intense and last years event really got me thinking. It&#8217;s also a pretty good business opportunity. You own your ideas whether you get on the labs or not, you get paid for your time attending them and you get to pitch your ideas to the commisioners at the end of it.</p>
<p>For an idea of what goes on, you spend alot of time doing thinks like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgLabs1.jpg" title="Flip charts rule" alt="Flip charts rule" /></p>
<p>And if you get really into it you might end up strutting around like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgLabs2.jpg" title="Getting in character helps too" alt="Getting in character helps too" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not all fun and games though. You might have to spend your time watching <span class="caps">BBC</span> employees play snooker on work time or playing the odd game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game)">werewolf</a>:</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgLabs3.jpg" title="Matt takes a shot" alt="Matt takes a shot" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/2008_the_brief.php">briefs</a> are already up that will form the core of the submission process in order to get on one of the labs. I&#8217;d recommend having a good read, picking a few you think are interesting and tie in with whatever your interests are at the moment and go from their.</p>
<p>With all that in mind I&#8217;m looking for people who fancy partnering up to brainstorm ideas, put together a few submissions and see if we get anywhere. I&#8217;m now working full time on freelance and consultancy gigs but the nature of the labs was that you need a team of at least two people. And anyway, ideas flow more freely with a few smart people sat around. So, if anyone fancies sitting around talking through a few of the briefs (and who knows, maybe drinking a glass of wine?) at some point over the next few months before the deadline let me know.</p>

    <p>Performance used to be something other people thought about. If you were working on a high traffic site for a large company, chances are they would throw inordinate amounts of expensive hardware at the problem. If you had a personal site only if you got really popular would you need more than a shared host. But the number of web applications being launched by small companies or individuals from their bedrooms is raising the awareness of the importance of performant websites.</p>
<p>Credit to <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! here. Google and Amazon might be the first companies that spring to mine when it comes to thinking about infrastructure but <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! have been publishing lots of useful, practical and interesting information in this area. <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a>, the Chief Performance <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! has a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/0596529309/">new book</a> going into detail about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!s performance rules</a>. The recent release of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> extension and another <a href="http://website-performance.org/">upcoming book</a> from <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2007/09/27/css-sprite-generator-tool/">Stuart Colville</a> and <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/">Ed Eliot</a> cap things off nicely.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combined files are a way to reduce the number of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and similarly combining all stylesheets into a single stylesheet. It&#8217;s a simple idea that hasn&#8217;t seen wide adoption. The ten top U.S. web sites average 7 scripts and 2 stylesheets per page. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While all that has been going on I&#8217;ve been working with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project and come across a great plugin; <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/pages/asset_packager">asset_packager</a> from <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/">Scott Becker</a>. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/serving-javascript-fast">Vitamin article</a> by <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal Henderson</a> (of Flickr and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-Henderson/dp/0596102356">another good book</a> fame), asset_packager compresses and merges <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript based on a prescribed configuration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also working on a few <span class="caps">PHP</span> projects and wanted the same experience in these as well, so  I&#8217;ve gone a put together a quick release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/">php asset packager</a>. At the moment this is a <span class="caps">CSS</span> only release, with Javascript features coming later, along with all the rest of the features of the Rails plugin and anything else I can think of or need.</p>
<p>First off you define your stylesheet setup. I used <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> as my goal was to stick as close as possible to the Rails plugin.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;stylesheets:
- base:
  - screen
  - header
- secondary:
  - foo
  - bar&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The above simply states that you want to merge screen and header <span class="caps">CSS</span> files together to form a base stylesheet, and merge foo and bar together to create a secondary <span class="caps">CSS</span> file.</p>
<p>All you then have to do is include the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;// define("ENVIRONMENT", "production");</p>
<p>echo Asset_packager::stylesheet_link_merged();</pre></code></p>
<p>If the <span class="caps">ENVIRONMENT</span> constant is set to <em>production</em> the line includes the merged stylesheet links, otherwise each file is included seperately. This again mirrors the behaviour of the Rails plugin. A command line script is also included in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/source">source</a> to actually merge (and <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a>) the <span class="caps">CSS</span> files.</p>
<p>The vague plan is to add the rest of the features and then maybe package up as a plugin for whatever software or frameworks I&#8217;m working with at the time. At the moment that probably means wordpress, <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">symfony</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">code igniter</a>. Everything is open source and available from svn over on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager">Google Code site</a>. Contributions, in the way of code, bugs, documentation or thoughts welcome.</p>

      <a href="/2007/10/23/my-trac-ticket-setup/">
        My Trac Ticket setup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been busy really getting to grips with <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> recently and thought I&#8217;d post up a few details. Trac for those that haven&#8217;t come across it is a wiki, issue tracking systems and source code browser all rolled into one. It&#8217;s open source and written in Python.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start off describing my current ticket setup, along with the code I use for reports. In future posts I&#8217;ll hopefully describe thinks like setting up users and permissions in a flexible way. I&#8217;ll leave describing <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracOnUbuntu">installation</a> to <a href="https://svn.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/trac/tracmods/wiki/InstallationGuide">others</a>, mainly because it&#8217;s a pain. I&#8217;ll also assume you&#8217;ve installed the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WebAdmin">WebAdmin</a> plugin, or are familiar with trac-admin.</p>
<h2>Create a new Ticket</h2>
<p>By default Trac comes set up with severity, milestones, ticket types, priority and components and a few default options in each. The problem with all these options is that it takes more time and effort to add and manage issues &#8211; so they don&#8217;t get logged. Unless you know you absolutely need them I find it easier to remove most of these options in the first instance.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgTracTicket.png" title="Trac new ticket" alt="Trac new ticket" /></p>
<p>I prefer using Trac soley for issue tracking. It suffers badly in my opinion if used for more project management related activity. <a href="http://basecamphq.com">Other tools</a> do that job better (and also do bug tracking poorly).</p>
<p>I keep priority in, but by default it&#8217;s blank and only has one other options &#8211; High. I only assign High priority to issues which are causing major problems, either preventing a successful build or stopping something happening that&#8217;s meant to.</p>
<h2>Available reports</h2>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgTracReports.png" title="Trac reports list" alt="Trac reports list" /></p>
<p>Trac reports are simple (or not so simple) <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries with a few bits of special syntax. I have four reports set up; Open, Closed, Important and My Issues:</p>
<p>Open, not too suprisingly, displays all the open issues. As mixing different components here would be confusing we divide the list with headers for each components</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component, 
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority,
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') 
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Closed is the reverse of Open (I&#8217;m starting to state the obvious here) but with a few differences in terms of the listing. I&#8217;m more bothered here about seeing a timeline of closed issues. Good for keeping a eye (or a feed) on to see progress.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner, component, resolution,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS modified,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status NOT IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') 
ORDER BY changetime DESC&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>My Issues lists only those issues which are assigned to me (or the currently logged in user) and open.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') AND owner = '$USER'
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Important is an overview of critical issues. Software can have small bugs and be perfectly usable in the vast majority of cases. But some issues either effect lots of users or prevent the system working at all. These High priority issues need addressing first, before anything else.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') AND priority = 'High'
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Interesting bits here include the following line which makes all High priority tasks have a red border:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;(CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>As a side note, I hadn&#8217;t written proper <span class="caps">SQL</span> for a while (all that <a href="www.digital-web.com/articles/hacking_open_apis/">hacking on APIs</a>). Suprisingly good fun as it turns out.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The main benefit of this setup is simplicity. Too many bug tracking systems are either way too complicated, or come with defaults which are on the complex side (I include Trac in this last category). <a href="http://garrettdimon.com">Garret Dimon</a> has been <a href="http://garrettdimon.com/archives/tags/tracker">writing</a> about the development of a new bug tracking system with a focus on simplicity. <a href="http://fixxbugs.com/">Fixx</a> and <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> are other products looking to fill this niche. That&#8217;s not to say larger teams don&#8217;t need to store more information than this, just that by starting small you can actually find out what you&#8217;re missing &#8211; rather than guessing and making the whole process of adding and fixing bugs a particularly painful one.</p>

        The Future of The Future of Web Apps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2007</span>

    <p><em>Continuing the catch up, as <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/mashup-demo/">mentioned</a>, here&#8217;s some thoughts on the recent <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps Expo</a> conference.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say the last Future of Web Apps (<span class="caps">FOWA</span>) event got a little stick due to what was seen as too many paid sponsors on stage lacking interesting things to say. Some designers and developers on the coal face also felt all the talk about startups just wasn&#8217;t relevant to their day jobs. So you have to hand it to the gang at <del>Carson Systems</del> <ins><a href="http://carsonified.com">Carsonified</a></ins> for coming back with an even bigger and better event which addressed most of these concerns.</p>
<p><a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.brianoberkirch.com/">Brian</a> came in to help with the speakers and at some point the event went for two tracks &#8211; the developer stage and the entreprenuers stage. At the same time the sponsors (supplemented by lots of smaller uk startups) moved into a large expo area outside the two stages. All this meant a move to <a href="http://www.excel-london.co.uk/en/">ExCel</a> which is a bit big, soulless and out of town for my liking but hey, how many places can deal with that many people with space to spare?</p>
<p><em>In the interests of fairness I have to say I <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/category/requires-action/">ended up helping out</a>, getting there early on the first day and standing behind the desk (with <a href="http://ibbydibby.com/cbetta/blog">Cristiano</a> and a few other nice people) for the mad rush at registration. I hadn&#8217;t worked on a large event for quite a while, I&#8217;d forgotten how much fun it can be! I don&#8217;t think that makes me biased though.</em></p>
<p>Highlights for me included <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a> on all sorts of interesting architecture bits and pieces learned from <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>, Heidi Pollock with practical tips for mobile web development, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> on startups in general (and why we all need to be in Silicon Valley apparently), the endlessly entertaining <a href="http://swardley.blogspot.com/">Simon Wardley</a> on ducks (and commodisation of online services) and <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/">Matt Biddulph</a> of <a href="http://dopplr.com">Dopplr</a> on practical tips for playing nice with social networks. Chatting with <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Sounders</a> and hearing about how he got the title of <em>Chief Performace <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!</em> was also good fun. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Souders">book</a> is on it&#8217;s way as I write.</p>
<p><a href="http://davemorin.com/blog/">Dave Morin</a> from Facebook was a disappointment. He basically showed everyone facebook (which I would imagine 99% of the audience are already on), talked up some huge numbers and then dodged questions about walled gardens and open data.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t make it into the entreprenuers stage as much as I should have done. <a href="http://donotremove.co.uk/">Mike Stenhouse</a> spent most of his time in there I think and had nice things to say about most of the talks. I caught <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/">Leisa Reichelt</a> and Dick Costolo, both of whom gave particularly interesting talks to round off the second day of the conference. Although at least some people I spoke to don&#8217;t like having more than one track (the same topic of conversation cropped up at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">@media</a>) I much prefer the choice of sessions. Missing the odd clash is a small price to pay for the larger number of interesting talks.</p>
<p>Overall; lots of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/group/future-of-web-applications/slideshows">interesting content from lots of interesting speakers</a> &#8211; many of whom I hadn&#8217;t seen speak previously (always a good sign). As for constructive criticism I&#8217;d have to say that the half hour slots of the developer track were probably a little too short in some cases and the conference was lacking in real, hands on, practical tech sessions.</p>
<p>One final thing that can&#8217;t go without mention; <a href="http://diggnation.com">Diggnation</a>. I had no idea what this was all about and quite frankly I&#8217;m not sure I do now. I&#8217;m still carrying the mental scars. I don&#8217;t think anyone can explain that in words so, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/2007-10-04London">video</a>.</p>
