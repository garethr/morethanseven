    <p>Performance used to be something other people thought about. If you were working on a high traffic site for a large company, chances are they would throw inordinate amounts of expensive hardware at the problem. If you had a personal site only if you got really popular would you need more than a shared host. But the number of web applications being launched by small companies or individuals from their bedrooms is raising the awareness of the importance of performant websites.</p>
<p>Credit to <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! here. Google and Amazon might be the first companies that spring to mine when it comes to thinking about infrastructure but <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! have been publishing lots of useful, practical and interesting information in this area. <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a>, the Chief Performance <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! has a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/0596529309/">new book</a> going into detail about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!s performance rules</a>. The recent release of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> extension and another <a href="http://website-performance.org/">upcoming book</a> from <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2007/09/27/css-sprite-generator-tool/">Stuart Colville</a> and <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/">Ed Eliot</a> cap things off nicely.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combined files are a way to reduce the number of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and similarly combining all stylesheets into a single stylesheet. It&#8217;s a simple idea that hasn&#8217;t seen wide adoption. The ten top U.S. web sites average 7 scripts and 2 stylesheets per page. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While all that has been going on I&#8217;ve been working with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project and come across a great plugin; <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/pages/asset_packager">asset_packager</a> from <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/">Scott Becker</a>. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/serving-javascript-fast">Vitamin article</a> by <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal Henderson</a> (of Flickr and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-Henderson/dp/0596102356">another good book</a> fame), asset_packager compresses and merges <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript based on a prescribed configuration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also working on a few <span class="caps">PHP</span> projects and wanted the same experience in these as well, so  I&#8217;ve gone a put together a quick release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/">php asset packager</a>. At the moment this is a <span class="caps">CSS</span> only release, with Javascript features coming later, along with all the rest of the features of the Rails plugin and anything else I can think of or need.</p>
<p>First off you define your stylesheet setup. I used <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> as my goal was to stick as close as possible to the Rails plugin.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;stylesheets:
- base:
  - screen
  - header
- secondary:
  - foo
  - bar&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The above simply states that you want to merge screen and header <span class="caps">CSS</span> files together to form a base stylesheet, and merge foo and bar together to create a secondary <span class="caps">CSS</span> file.</p>
<p>All you then have to do is include the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;// define("ENVIRONMENT", "production");</p>
<p>echo Asset_packager::stylesheet_link_merged();</pre></code></p>
<p>If the <span class="caps">ENVIRONMENT</span> constant is set to <em>production</em> the line includes the merged stylesheet links, otherwise each file is included seperately. This again mirrors the behaviour of the Rails plugin. A command line script is also included in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/source">source</a> to actually merge (and <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a>) the <span class="caps">CSS</span> files.</p>
<p>The vague plan is to add the rest of the features and then maybe package up as a plugin for whatever software or frameworks I&#8217;m working with at the time. At the moment that probably means wordpress, <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">symfony</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">code igniter</a>. Everything is open source and available from svn over on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager">Google Code site</a>. Contributions, in the way of code, bugs, documentation or thoughts welcome.</p>

      <a href="/2007/10/23/my-trac-ticket-setup/">
        My Trac Ticket setup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Oct 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been busy really getting to grips with <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> recently and thought I&#8217;d post up a few details. Trac for those that haven&#8217;t come across it is a wiki, issue tracking systems and source code browser all rolled into one. It&#8217;s open source and written in Python.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start off describing my current ticket setup, along with the code I use for reports. In future posts I&#8217;ll hopefully describe thinks like setting up users and permissions in a flexible way. I&#8217;ll leave describing <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracOnUbuntu">installation</a> to <a href="https://svn.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/trac/tracmods/wiki/InstallationGuide">others</a>, mainly because it&#8217;s a pain. I&#8217;ll also assume you&#8217;ve installed the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WebAdmin">WebAdmin</a> plugin, or are familiar with trac-admin.</p>
<h2>Create a new Ticket</h2>
<p>By default Trac comes set up with severity, milestones, ticket types, priority and components and a few default options in each. The problem with all these options is that it takes more time and effort to add and manage issues &#8211; so they don&#8217;t get logged. Unless you know you absolutely need them I find it easier to remove most of these options in the first instance.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgTracTicket.png" title="Trac new ticket" alt="Trac new ticket" /></p>
<p>I prefer using Trac soley for issue tracking. It suffers badly in my opinion if used for more project management related activity. <a href="http://basecamphq.com">Other tools</a> do that job better (and also do bug tracking poorly).</p>
<p>I keep priority in, but by default it&#8217;s blank and only has one other options &#8211; High. I only assign High priority to issues which are causing major problems, either preventing a successful build or stopping something happening that&#8217;s meant to.</p>
<h2>Available reports</h2>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgTracReports.png" title="Trac reports list" alt="Trac reports list" /></p>
<p>Trac reports are simple (or not so simple) <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries with a few bits of special syntax. I have four reports set up; Open, Closed, Important and My Issues:</p>
<p>Open, not too suprisingly, displays all the open issues. As mixing different components here would be confusing we divide the list with headers for each components</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component, 
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority,
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') 
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Closed is the reverse of Open (I&#8217;m starting to state the obvious here) but with a few differences in terms of the listing. I&#8217;m more bothered here about seeing a timeline of closed issues. Good for keeping a eye (or a feed) on to see progress.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner, component, resolution,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS modified,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status NOT IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') 
ORDER BY changetime DESC&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>My Issues lists only those issues which are assigned to me (or the currently logged in user) and open.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') AND owner = '$USER'
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Important is an overview of critical issues. Software can have small bugs and be perfectly usable in the vast majority of cases. But some issues either effect lots of users or prevent the system working at all. These High priority issues need addressing first, before anything else.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;SELECT
  component AS &amp;#95;group&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  (CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,
  id, summary, owner,
  time AS created,
  component AS &amp;#95;component,
  priority AS &amp;#95;priority, 
  changetime AS &amp;#95;changetime,
  description AS &amp;#95;description
FROM ticket t
LEFT JOIN enum p ON p.name = t.priority AND p.type = 'priority'
WHERE status IN ('new', 'assigned', 'reopened') AND priority = 'High'
ORDER BY priority DESC, p.value, t.type, time&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Interesting bits here include the following line which makes all High priority tasks have a red border:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;(CASE priority WHEN 'High' THEN '1' ELSE '' END) AS &amp;#95;&amp;#95;color&amp;#95;&amp;#95;,&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>As a side note, I hadn&#8217;t written proper <span class="caps">SQL</span> for a while (all that <a href="www.digital-web.com/articles/hacking_open_apis/">hacking on APIs</a>). Suprisingly good fun as it turns out.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The main benefit of this setup is simplicity. Too many bug tracking systems are either way too complicated, or come with defaults which are on the complex side (I include Trac in this last category). <a href="http://garrettdimon.com">Garret Dimon</a> has been <a href="http://garrettdimon.com/archives/tags/tracker">writing</a> about the development of a new bug tracking system with a focus on simplicity. <a href="http://fixxbugs.com/">Fixx</a> and <a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a> are other products looking to fill this niche. That&#8217;s not to say larger teams don&#8217;t need to store more information than this, just that by starting small you can actually find out what you&#8217;re missing &#8211; rather than guessing and making the whole process of adding and fixing bugs a particularly painful one.</p>

        The Future of The Future of Web Apps
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2007</span>

    <p><em>Continuing the catch up, as <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/mashup-demo/">mentioned</a>, here&#8217;s some thoughts on the recent <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps Expo</a> conference.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s fair to say the last Future of Web Apps (<span class="caps">FOWA</span>) event got a little stick due to what was seen as too many paid sponsors on stage lacking interesting things to say. Some designers and developers on the coal face also felt all the talk about startups just wasn&#8217;t relevant to their day jobs. So you have to hand it to the gang at <del>Carson Systems</del> <ins><a href="http://carsonified.com">Carsonified</a></ins> for coming back with an even bigger and better event which addressed most of these concerns.</p>
<p><a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.brianoberkirch.com/">Brian</a> came in to help with the speakers and at some point the event went for two tracks &#8211; the developer stage and the entreprenuers stage. At the same time the sponsors (supplemented by lots of smaller uk startups) moved into a large expo area outside the two stages. All this meant a move to <a href="http://www.excel-london.co.uk/en/">ExCel</a> which is a bit big, soulless and out of town for my liking but hey, how many places can deal with that many people with space to spare?</p>
<p><em>In the interests of fairness I have to say I <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/category/requires-action/">ended up helping out</a>, getting there early on the first day and standing behind the desk (with <a href="http://ibbydibby.com/cbetta/blog">Cristiano</a> and a few other nice people) for the mad rush at registration. I hadn&#8217;t worked on a large event for quite a while, I&#8217;d forgotten how much fun it can be! I don&#8217;t think that makes me biased though.</em></p>
<p>Highlights for me included <a href="http://photomatt.net/">Matt Mullenweg</a> on all sorts of interesting architecture bits and pieces learned from <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>, Heidi Pollock with practical tips for mobile web development, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> on startups in general (and why we all need to be in Silicon Valley apparently), the endlessly entertaining <a href="http://swardley.blogspot.com/">Simon Wardley</a> on ducks (and commodisation of online services) and <a href="http://www.hackdiary.com/">Matt Biddulph</a> of <a href="http://dopplr.com">Dopplr</a> on practical tips for playing nice with social networks. Chatting with <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Sounders</a> and hearing about how he got the title of <em>Chief Performace <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!</em> was also good fun. The <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/High-Performance-Web-Sites-Souders">book</a> is on it&#8217;s way as I write.</p>
<p><a href="http://davemorin.com/blog/">Dave Morin</a> from Facebook was a disappointment. He basically showed everyone facebook (which I would imagine 99% of the audience are already on), talked up some huge numbers and then dodged questions about walled gardens and open data.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t make it into the entreprenuers stage as much as I should have done. <a href="http://donotremove.co.uk/">Mike Stenhouse</a> spent most of his time in there I think and had nice things to say about most of the talks. I caught <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/">Leisa Reichelt</a> and Dick Costolo, both of whom gave particularly interesting talks to round off the second day of the conference. Although at least some people I spoke to don&#8217;t like having more than one track (the same topic of conversation cropped up at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">@media</a>) I much prefer the choice of sessions. Missing the odd clash is a small price to pay for the larger number of interesting talks.</p>
<p>Overall; lots of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/group/future-of-web-applications/slideshows">interesting content from lots of interesting speakers</a> &#8211; many of whom I hadn&#8217;t seen speak previously (always a good sign). As for constructive criticism I&#8217;d have to say that the half hour slots of the developer track were probably a little too short in some cases and the conference was lacking in real, hands on, practical tech sessions.</p>
<p>One final thing that can&#8217;t go without mention; <a href="http://diggnation.com">Diggnation</a>. I had no idea what this was all about and quite frankly I&#8217;m not sure I do now. I&#8217;m still carrying the mental scars. I don&#8217;t think anyone can explain that in words so, here&#8217;s the <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/2007-10-04London">video</a>.</p>

        Mashup Demo

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Oct 2007</span>

    <p><em>Long time no post. Lots of excuses, time away (including a holiday) and work catching up with me. Hopefully expect a few quick fire posts to catch up and then back to normal.</em></p>
<p>I was in London a couple of weeks back, mainly to help out at <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com"><span class="caps">FOWA</span></a> (which can get it&#8217;s own post) but also to generally catch up with lots of people about interesting stuff. After using my Monopoly knowledge of London to find the apple store (something some <a href="http://www.thecssdiv.co.uk/">Londers</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/rossbruniges/statuses/307080542">took issue with</a>) I heard about an event round the corner thanks to the magic of the internets (in this case <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> and <a href="http://www.builtbydave.co.uk/">Dave Stone</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mashupevent.com/event/mashup-demo">Mashup Demo</a> was billed as &#8220;a simple and effective way for startups, growing businesses, enterprises and corporates to present themselves to an audience of professionals who would include:- investors, media journalists and bloggers, potential partners and industry influencers&#8221;. When first chatting with one of the exhibiting companies they looked me up and down and said &#8220;so, are you a blogger?&#8221;. Apparently I didn&#8217;t look much like a VC. Who knew?</p>
<p>Fifteen lightning presentations made up the bulk of the event, with me taking notes using my handy N800 (another blog post probably), and then followed a good amount of time to wander about and chat with everyone, probably about 100 people all in all. The companies presenting represented lots of the <em>hot topics</em> at the moment shall we say. Anyone not mentioning mobile, or social networking (or both!) had come to the wrong party.</p>
<p>Local Search had a strong showing from <a href="http://welovelocal.com">welovelocal.com</a>, <a href="http://www.rummble.com">Rumble</a>, and <a href="http://www.tipped.co.uk">tipped.co.uk</a>. The thorny problem of local was one of the really interesting discussion topics at the <a href="http://open.bbc.co.uk/labs/"><span class="caps">BBC</span> innovation labs</a> earlier in the year and it&#8217;s good to see interesting ideas of how to solve it. Although personally I don&#8217;t need <em>another</em> social network and also want to be able to define what I mean by local (not just be given a location, or have it based on a pool of friends, or whatever the latest looking glass is).</p>
<p>Identity was suprisingly popular with both <a href="http://www.bondaii.com">Bondai</a> and <a href="http://www.meecard.com/">meecards</a> talking up their applications. Obviously with all the cool kids playing with <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenId</a> and the alpha geeks tinkering with <a href="http://oauth.net/">OAuth</a> identity is technologically interesting, but both these companies have spotted commercial opportunities as well. Be interesting to see how this all plays out. I&#8217;ve rambled on before about what I called Banks for Data (as apposed to money, which is just data anyhow when you think about it) but not really considered early movers and entrepreneurs in this sector.</p>
<p>A couple of interesting takes on agregators dropped in as well.<br />
<a href="http://fav.or.it/">fav.or.it</a> was pitched as trying to popularise feeds for everyone else, but looked to me to actually be more of a useful tool for the information hungry crowd. It&#8217;s innovative features (inline commenting looked nice) would likely not be that interesting to people with only a few feeds and a few minutes but for people with hundreds of feeds look interesting. <a href="http://www.magpie.net/brandwatch.html">Brandwatch</a> was similar to an idea a friend and me kicked around a while back, but never put together. Simply put it finds stories relating to your brand (company, product, whatever) and ascertains the importance and whether it&#8217;s positive or negative. You can then track all that over time with useful graphs and charts and the like. At the moment they are indexing about 500,000 sites and it still uses some manual filtering I think. Even so I know of clients past who would definately find the service offered interesting.</p>
<p>A few others caught my eye; an ad network for bloggers based on their blog rolls called <a href="http://www.rollsense.com/">rollSense</a>, a service simliar to <a href="htp://slideshare.com">slideshare</a> but for business documents called &#8220;Edocr&#8221;:&quot;http://www.edocr.com/ and <a href="http://testcard.tv">testcard.tv</a>. Testcard.tv does some really pretty impressive agregation, stitching and searching of online video. Sort of a glimpse of the future, but probably not as pretty. Optimising that for the Wii or PS3 (or keyboard/remote control) would be awesome.</p>
<p>After chatting with a few of the companies, and other people in the crowd, I popped for sushi with the aforementioned Dave for discussions of the freelance life I&#8217;ve got myself in to. The event was pretty darn interesting. That the companies presenting were, for the majority, proper startups was interesting. And the fact the whole event was geared around product centric companies and the surrounding eco-system interested me. I get to similar business events up and around newcastle, but these tend to be more service company orientated it seems. All in all Mashup Demo kicked my stay down in London off nicely.</p>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve tinkered with a rather large number of these web application frameworks, in Ruby, Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span> and C#, at some point over the last few years. But I&#8217;ve never really settled on any of them &#8211; mainly because my day job didn&#8217;t need me to and also because I like playing with new toys. I even tinkered with <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/webphp/">my own homage</a> to <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a> in <span class="caps">PHP</span> which a few people have picked and are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wephp/">running with</a>.</p>
<p>Right now though I&#8217;ve been doing some work with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project. Their are some seriously nice things in Rails that I don&#8217;t see elsewhere; really good testing support baked in for one, and some serious deplyments for another.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">Symfony</a> is another <span class="caps">PHP</span> framework but one that only supports PHP5 (a good thing in my book). It&#8217;s basically a slick integration of lots of existing mature <span class="caps">PHP</span> tools plus some good old <span class="caps">MVC</span> and tried and trusted Software Patterns. I also discovered from a few YAHOO&#8217;s that they have started using it on some levels within <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>.</p>
<p>My interest piqued I found a couple of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fullo/federico-feroldi-php-in-yahoo/">related</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dustin.whittle/symfony-yui-professional-web-20">presentations</a> on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> (my new favourite web app), and the site has a <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/book/1_0">high quality online documentation</a> which can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-Symfony-Experts-Source/dp/1590597869">purchased in dead tree format</a>.</p>
<p>Having a play around with Symfony it took me a little while to get everything up and running, but I&#8217;d kept some handy notes for later. Hopefully they might be useful to someone other than me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve dropped in a few variables denoted by braces where relevant. The paths are from my <span class="caps">MAMP</span> and <span class="caps">PEAR</span> based environment and I&#8217;m using a MySQL database, though you could just as easily use Sqlite.</p>
<p>First we set up a virtual host in Apache. You have to do this manually at the moment. I already have a script for setting up virtual hosts under apache on OS X which I might extend to do this for me if I end up using Symfony alot.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;
  ServerName 
  DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/{project}/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  Alias /sf /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf
  &lt;Directory "/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf"&gt;
    AllowOverride All 
    Allow from All</p>
</Directory>
&lt;Directory &#8220;/Applications/<span class="caps">MAMP</span>/htdocs/{project}/web&#8221;&gt;
AllowOverride All
Allow from All
</Directory>
<p></VirtualHost></pre></code></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;cd /www
mkdir {project}
cd {project}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now we dive into the actual symfony commands. We&#8217;ll just setting up both a frontend and a backend for this app which I think is likely to be pretty typical. I quite like the idea of seperate entities for these.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-project {project_name}
symfony init-app frontend
symfony init-module frontend {module_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Next we have to configure our database connection by editing /config/databases.yml</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;all:
    propel:
      class: sfPropelDatabase
      param:
        dsn: mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>That done we can set up our data definitions in <em>/config/schema.yml</em>. Read the documention for all the details but you can probably get the general idea.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel:
 item:
   id:
   title: varchar(200)
   description: longvarchar
   created_at:&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>And yet another quick change in <em>/config/propel.ini</em></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel.database.createUrl = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306
propel.database.url = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The next set of commands build our model files, create <span class="caps">SQL</span> for out chosen database and then create the tables in the database.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony propel-build-model
symfony propel-build-sql
symfony propel-insert-sql&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll quickly create a backend using the scaffolding. Note that <em>item</em> here is the model name which is taken from the <em>schema.yml</em> config file above.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-app backend
symfony propel-generate-crud backend items Item&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>All in all not bad going. And that&#8217;s basically the same for most of the apps you&#8217;re likely to develop. It could probably be a little easier in the database and apache config areas in fairness. Rails&#8217; use of an inbuild webserver really helps here. But the use of <span class="caps">YAML</span> to define the model is, in my mind, more straightforward that using Ruby in Rails migrations. I&#8217;ve an app in the works at the moment and I&#8217;m looking at using Symfony. If that pans out I&#8217;ll blog more about the bits I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; the inbuilt unit testing framework high on my list.</p>
