        Javascript In Your Ruby: Mongoid Map Reduce
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Oct 2011</span>

    <p>We&#8217;re pretty fond of <a href="http://mongodb.org/">Mongodb</a> at work and I&#8217;ve been getting an opportunity to kick some of the more interesting tyres recently. I thought I&#8217;d document something I found myself doing here, half hoping it might be useful for anyone else with a similar problem and also to see if anyone else has a much neater approach. The examples are obviously pretty trivial, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;re making using of the rather nice <a href="http://mongoid.org/">Mongoid</a> Ruby library for defining our models as Ruby classes. Here&#8217;s a couple of very simple classes. Anyone familiar with DataMapper or Django&#8217;s <span class="caps">ORM</span> should be right at home here.</p>
<pre>class Publication
  include Mongoid::Document

  field :name,            :type =&gt; String
  field :section,         :type =&gt; String
  field :body,            :type =&gt; String
  field :is_published,    :type =&gt; Boolean
end

class LongerPublication &lt; Publication
  field :extra_body,      :type =&gt; String
end
</pre>
<p>So we now have a good few publications and longer publications in our system. And folks have been creating sections with wild amandon. What I&#8217;d like to do now is do some reporting, specifically I want to know the numbers of Publications by type and publication status. And lets allow a breakdown by section while we&#8217;re at it.</p>
<p>One approach to this is using Mongo&#8217;s built in map-reduce capability. Mongoid exposes this pretty cleanly in my view, by allowing you to write the required javascript functions (a mapper and a reducer) inline in the Ruby code. This might feel evil, but seems the best of the available options. I can see for much larger functions that splitting this out into separate javascript files for ease of testing might be nice, but were you can just test the input/output of the whole job this works for me.</p>
<pre>KLASS = "this._type"
SECTION = "this.section"

def self.count_by(type)
  map = &lt;&lt;EOF
    function() {
      function truthy(value) {
        return (value == true) ? 1 : 0;
      }
      emit(#{type}, {type: #{type}, count: 1, published: truthy(this.is_published)})
    }
EOF

  reduce = &lt;&lt;EOF
    function(key, values) {
      var count = 0; published = 0;
      values.forEach(function(doc) {
        count += parseInt(doc.count);
        published += parseInt(doc.published);
        type = doc.type
      );
      return {type: type, count: count, published: published}
    }
EOF

  collection.mapreduce(map, reduce).find()

end
</pre>
<p>In our case that will return something like the following, or rather more specifically it will return a Mongo::Cursor that allows you to get at the following data.</p>
<pre>[{"_id"=&gt;"Publication", "value"=&gt;{"type"=&gt;"Publication", "count"=&gt;42.0, "published"=&gt;29.0}},
{"_id"=&gt;"LongerPublication", "value"=&gt;{"type"=&gt;"LongerPublication", "count"=&gt;12.0, "published"=&gt;10.0}}]
</pre>
<p>I&#8217;ve been pretty impressed with both Mongo and Mongoid here. I like the feel of mapreduce jobs for this sort of reporting task. In particular it&#8217;s suprising how writing two languages mixed together like this doesn&#8217;t really affect the readability of the code in my view. Given that with a relational database you&#8217;d probably be writing <span class="caps">SQL</span> anyway maybe that&#8217;s not that suprising &#8211; the syntactic differences between Javascript and Ruby are much smaller than pretty much anything and <span class="caps">SQL</span>. Lots of folks have written about the increase of polyglot programming, but I wonder if we&#8217;ll see an increase in the embedding of one language in another?</p>

        Rundeck And Nagios Nrpe Checks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://rundeck.org/">Rundeck</a> recently. For those that haven&#8217;t seen it yet it&#8217;s an application for running commands across a cluster of machines and recording the results. It has both a command line client and a very rich web interface which boths allows you to trigger commands and shows the results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve played with a few different jobs so far, including triggering Puppet runs across machines triggered by a Jenkins plugin. I&#8217;ve also been looking at running all my monitoring tasks at the click of a button (or again as part of a smoke test triggered by Jenkins) and I thought that might make a nice simple example.</p>
<p>My checks are written as Nagios plugins, and run periodically by Nagios. I also trigger them manually, using Dean&#8217;s <a href="http://www.unixdaemon.net/tools/commandline/introducing-nrpe-runner.html"><span class="caps">NRPE</span> runner script</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiJoQIM" alt="Rundeck showing a job output"/></p>
<p>The above shows a successful run across a few machines I use for experimenting with tools. Hopefully you can see the summary of the run on each of the four machines, each ran five <span class="caps">NRPE</span> checks and all passed. On failure we&#8217;d see the results as well as different symbols and colous. We can easily save the output to a file if we need to, rerun or duplicate the job (maybe to have it run against a different group of machines) or we can export the job definition file to load into another instance.</p>
<p>The same job can also be run on the command line (which makes use the of Rundeck <span class="caps">API</span>)</p>
<pre>./run -j "Run NRPE checks" -p PRGMR</pre>
<p>This example shows running a specific pre-defined job, but it&#8217;s also equally possible to fire of adhoc commands to some or all of the machines rundeck knows about.</p>
<p>One thing in particular that I prefer about this approach to say using Capistrano or Fabric for remote execution tasks is that you have a centralised authentication and logging capability. It would be easy enough to encapsulate the jobs into cap or fabric tasks (and manage that in source control) which means you&#8217;re not stuck if Rundeck isn&#8217;t available.</p>

    <p>This blog post is mainly an excuse to use the pun in the title. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to tell folks that don&#8217;t already know I&#8217;ll be starting a new job on Monday working for the UK Government. I&#8217;m going to be work for the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>, a new department tasked with a pretty wide range of sorting the Government out online.</p>
<p>The opportunity is huge. And when it came around I couldn&#8217;t turn it down. I&#8217;m going to be working with a bunch of people I&#8217;ve <a href="http://memespring.co.uk/">known</a> <a href="http://nicepaul.com/">and</a> <a href="http://fberriman.com/">respected</a> for a while, as well as other equally smart people. That means I&#8217;m going to be back in London again as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to talk lots about what we&#8217;re up to. The groundwork for that has already been laid by the <a href="http://alpha.gov.uk">alpha.gov</a> team who have been blogging furiously about topics of interest.</p>

        Vim With Ruby Support Using Homebrew
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve spend a bit of time this weekend cleaning, tidying and upgrading software on my mac. While doing that I got round to compiling my own Vim. I&#8217;d been meaning to do this for a while, I prefer using Vim in a terminal to using MacVim, and I like having access to things like <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">Command-T</a> which requires Ruby support which the inbuild version lacks.</p>
<p>Vim isn&#8217;t in Homebrew, because Homebrew&#8217;s policy is to not provide duplicates of already installed software. Enter <a href="https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt">Homebrew Alt</a> which provides formulas for anything not allowed by the homebrew policy. As luck would have it a <a href="https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/blob/master/duplicates/vim.rb">Vim Formula</a> already exists. And installing from it couldn&#8217;t be easier.</p>
<pre>brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb</pre>
<p>As it turns out this failed the first time I ran it because I had an rvm installed Ruby on my path. I reset this to the system version and everything compiled fine.</p>
<pre>rvm use system</pre>
<p>Note also that it&#8217;s really quite simple to use a different revision or different flags when compiling. Just download that file, modify it, serve it locally (say with a python one line web server) and point brew install at it. Next step, running off head for all the latest and greatest Vim features.</p>
