    <p>This blog post is mainly an excuse to use the pun in the title. It&#8217;s also an opportunity to tell folks that don&#8217;t already know I&#8217;ll be starting a new job on Monday working for the UK Government. I&#8217;m going to be work for the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a>, a new department tasked with a pretty wide range of sorting the Government out online.</p>
<p>The opportunity is huge. And when it came around I couldn&#8217;t turn it down. I&#8217;m going to be working with a bunch of people I&#8217;ve <a href="http://memespring.co.uk/">known</a> <a href="http://nicepaul.com/">and</a> <a href="http://fberriman.com/">respected</a> for a while, as well as other equally smart people. That means I&#8217;m going to be back in London again as well.</p>
<p>Hopefully I&#8217;ll be able to talk lots about what we&#8217;re up to. The groundwork for that has already been laid by the <a href="http://alpha.gov.uk">alpha.gov</a> team who have been blogging furiously about topics of interest.</p>

        Vim With Ruby Support Using Homebrew

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve spend a bit of time this weekend cleaning, tidying and upgrading software on my mac. While doing that I got round to compiling my own Vim. I&#8217;d been meaning to do this for a while, I prefer using Vim in a terminal to using MacVim, and I like having access to things like <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025">Command-T</a> which requires Ruby support which the inbuild version lacks.</p>
<p>Vim isn&#8217;t in Homebrew, because Homebrew&#8217;s policy is to not provide duplicates of already installed software. Enter <a href="https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt">Homebrew Alt</a> which provides formulas for anything not allowed by the homebrew policy. As luck would have it a <a href="https://github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/blob/master/duplicates/vim.rb">Vim Formula</a> already exists. And installing from it couldn&#8217;t be easier.</p>
<pre>brew install https://raw.github.com/adamv/homebrew-alt/master/duplicates/vim.rb</pre>
<p>As it turns out this failed the first time I ran it because I had an rvm installed Ruby on my path. I reset this to the system version and everything compiled fine.</p>
<pre>rvm use system</pre>
<p>Note also that it&#8217;s really quite simple to use a different revision or different flags when compiling. Just download that file, modify it, serve it locally (say with a python one line web server) and point brew install at it. Next step, running off head for all the latest and greatest Vim features.</p>

        Jenkins Build Pipeline Example
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>The idea of a build pipeline for web application deployment appears to have picked up lots of interest from the excellent <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/">Continuous Delivery</a> book. Inspired by that, some nice folks have build an excellent plugin for Jenkins unsurprisingly called the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin">Build Pipeline Plugin</a>. Here&#8217;s a quick example of how I&#8217;m using it for one of my projects*.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRihmQIM" alt="Build pipeline example in Jenkins"/></p>
<p>The pipeline is really just a visualisation of up and downstream builds in Jenkins given a starting point, plus the ability to setup manual steps rather than just the default build after ones. That means the steps are completely up to you and your project. In this case I&#8217;m using:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Build &#8211; downloads the latest code and any dependencies. You could also create a system package here if you like. If successful triggers&#8230;</li>
	<li>Staging deploy &#8211; In this case I&#8217;m using capistrano, but it could easily have been rsync, fabric or triggering a chef or puppet run. If successful triggers&#8230;</li>
	<li>Staging test &#8211; This is a simple automated test suite that checks that the site on staging is correct. The tests are bundled with the code, so are pulled down as part of the build step. If the tests pass&#8230;</li>
	<li>Staging approval &#8211; This is one of the clever parts of the plugin. This jenkins job actually does nothing except log it&#8217;s successful activation. It&#8217;s only run when I press the Trigger button on the pipeline view. This acts as a nice manual gate for a once over check on staging.</li>
	<li>Production deploy &#8211; using the same artifact as deployed to staging this job triggers the deploy to the production site again via capistrano</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;m triggering builds on each commit too via a webhook. But I can also kick off a build by clicking the button the pipeline view if I need to.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRi5kQIM" alt="Pipeline example showing build in progress"/></p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m only allowing the last build to be deployed given only that one can be checked on staging. Again this is configuration specific to my usage, the plugins lets you operate a number of different ways. There are a number of tweaks I want to make to this, mainly around experimenting with parameterized builds to pass useful information downstream and even allow parrallel execution. For the moment I have the <em>Block build when upstream project is building</em> flag checked on the deploy.</p>
&nbsp;* Yes, this is a one page site. With a 5 step build process in Jenkins including a small suite of functional tests and a staging environment. This is what we call overengineering.

    <span class="post-date">07 Jul 2011</span>

    <p>I did a quick lightning talk at the Refresh Cambridge meetup last night, a very quick introduction to <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/">Varnish</a>. Given 10 minutes all I really wanted to do was get people to go away and take a look at it. Lots of folks in the room hadn&#8217;t come across it before so I think the talk was hopefully well pitched.</p>

<p>Several people asked about slighly dynamic pages and I only got chance to mention support for <a href="https://www.varnish-cache.org/trac/wiki/ESIfeatures"><span class="caps">ESI</span></a> (Edge Side Includes) at the end. Conversation afterwards turned to various parts of the modern web stack and I had a pretty good time being opinionated. Hopefully more of the same next month.</p>
