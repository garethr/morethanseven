  <h1 class="post-title">Sinatra Simple Example</h1>
  <span class="post-date">01 Feb 2009</span>
  <p>I&#8217;ve been playing around with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinarta</a> Ruby web development framework recently and building a <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">larger than usual Hello World Example</a>. It&#8217;s describes itself as <em>a <span class="caps">DSL</span> for quickly creating web-applications in Ruby with minimal effort</em> (what is it about Ruby people and their obsession with calling everything a <span class="caps">DSL</span>?). In reality it&#8217;s a great little web framework. It deals with a minimal set of the things you really need to do as part of any application &#8211; <span class="caps">URL</span> handling and routing, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request and response handling, etc. It reminds me of <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> in it&#8217;s minimalist approach which is definitely a good thing.</p>
<p>The following example is the hello world given on the site</p>
<pre>require 'rubygems'
require 'sinatra'
get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end</pre>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t a million miles away from a web.py example:</p>
<pre>import web
urls = (
    '/', 'hello'
)
app = web.application(urls, globals())
class hello:        
    def GET(self, name):
        return 'Hello World'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()</pre>
<p>The only real difference is the separate mapping of URLs to views in web.py, which is closer to how Rails or Django do things.</p>
<p>Their is quite a bit of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/documentation.html">documentation</a> already for Sinatra, including the start of a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/book.html">book</a>. The code (as with all good code these days) is on <a href="http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/tree/master">github</a> for your forking pleasure.</p>
<p>As for what I&#8217;ve been up to I have a more advanced <a href="http://github.com/garethr/sinatra-hello-world">Hello World</a> example up on GitHub. I&#8217;m wanting to get a running application that demonstrates all the basic features (except <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2008/04/11/dsls-for-html-and-css-the-future-or-just-plain-wro/"><span class="caps">HAML</span> and <span class="caps">SASS</span></a> support). So far I&#8217;ve got a simple bit of Rack middleware, several views demonstrating different url handling techniques, basic erb templates, before methods, configuration settings, error handling, decent unit test coverage, a rake file with a tasks for documentation, code coverage, etc. I&#8217;ve also got configuration files for running the application with <a href="http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/">Thin</a> and using <a href="http://god.rubyforge.org/">God</a>. I&#8217;m going to add some simple database connectivity in at some point (either <a href="http://datamapper.org">DataMapper</a> or <a href="http://sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a>, I haven&#8217;t decided yet) and play around with writing spec tests and a capistrano recipe file. All in it&#8217;s a nice way of learning something new at the same time as producing something that might be useful. Once I have the rest of the bits and pieces I might even right a full tutorial.</p>
<p>I think the sweet spot for these sorts of mini frameworks are small services or little applications that just sit their are run. Both <a href="http://integrityapp.com/">Integrity</a> and <a href="http://irclogger.com">IRCLogger</a> both use Sinatra for instance and I think it&#8217;s used for the <a href="http://github.com/guides/post-receive-hooks">GitHub WebHooks</a> as well. It&#8217;s exactly the sort of thing Google AppEngine is useful for in fact and Sinatra would likely be a closer fit that Rails if Google ever feel like adding Ruby support. Although it does depress me a little that the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/list">top four items in the public issue tracker</a> are <em>I want my own language</em>.</p>
