        JRuby Vs Python.NET
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Nov 2006</span>

    <p>I got to thinking recently, after playing around with more <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython">IronPython</a> and talking with a Ruby fan, about the future of computer languages. Is their a war brewing between Python and Ruby in unexpected quarters? That quarter being the .<span class="caps">NET</span> and Java croud.</p>
 <p>Personally I&#8217;m too much of a fan of dynamic languages to be wholly impartial, but working in a mainly .<span class="caps">NET</span> shop I&#8217;m following IronPython when I get a chance, and a friendly Java officionando seemed pretty pleased with <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">JRuby</a> (although why not <a href="http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html">Jython</a> I&#8217;m not sure?) when last I spoke with them.</p>
 <p>Java and .<span class="caps">NET</span> are the prime candidates when it comes to big companies buying software, and all of that investment isn&#8217;t going to go to waste any time soon. But the potential speed benefits of Python or Ruby, and the work already going on with the likes of JRuby, Jython and IronPython, could make for a smooth transition.</p>
 <p>I guess only time will tell, and I&#8217;m sure some people are still not convinced when it comes to dynamic languages (heathens). In the meantime I&#8217;ve ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949">Beyond Java</a> by <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/batate/">Bruce Tate</a> to do some swatting up.</p>

    <p>In between personal projects, sleep and work I dont think time exists at the moment, but a few of those efforts are starting to bear fruit.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve just had my <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/reviews/dev/using-microformats-by-brian-suda/">first book review published</a> over on <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com">Vitamin</a>, a review of <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian Suda&#8217;s</a> Using Microformats. Hopefully this will be the first of many.</p>
 <p>Let me know what you think.</p>
 <p>This will probably have some sort of effect on the hibernating <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">webdesignbookshelf.com</a> that I&#8217;ve simply not had time to maintain. This was I just get to concentrate on writing reviews, although I have a few ideas for the site which dont clash with that.</p>
 <p>More personal web related news soon. If for no other reason than to prove I really am busy!</p>

        An apology to XSLT
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Oct 2006</span>

    <p>I have to admit to thinking that <span class="caps">XSL</span> was something of a waste of time a while back. I&#8217;ve changed my mine and wanted to muse about why.</p>
 <p><span class="caps">XML</span> is simple enough to jump right in, and a few years back it had a big enough band wagon to mean jumping on was pretty much required. I think in hindsight, at least in my mind, alot of this was just a little gratuitous. <span class="caps">XML</span> abstraction layers, <span class="caps">XML</span> content management systems, <span class="caps">SOAP</span>, etc.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;d often seen <span class="caps">XSLT</span> as the template layer in an <span class="caps">XML</span> based content management system and after several looks went back to using light weight systems that made sense. The idea of going from a database to <span class="caps">XML</span> then outputting <span class="caps">HTML</span> via <span class="caps">XSLT</span> just made me wonder why. The rationale that you could then output it as anything (<span class="caps">WML</span>, <span class="caps">PDF</span>, whatever) was very nice, but rarely actually realised from what I saw, and easy enough to do with any half decent templating system. You also always seemed to need more <span class="caps">XSLT</span> that it looked like you should.</p>
 <p><a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> even wore as a badge of honor that it didn&#8217;t need to do any <span class="caps">XML</span> pushups to deal with configuration. And even those with a penchant for Java seem to have problems with using <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com/printArticle/column-20060901-05.html"><span class="caps">XML</span> as a programming language</a>.</p>
 <p>Of late though I&#8217;ve been back playing with APIs, many of which produce <span class="caps">XML</span> in one way or another (whether that&#8217;s <span class="caps">RSS</span>, Atom or some custom format), and <span class="caps">XSL</span> actually comes in pretty handy here for just thowing around content. I did some work with a <a href="http://mini.google.co.uk">Google Mini</a> too using <span class="caps">XSLT</span> and their are some <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">interesting tricks</a> with <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> to boot. I haven&#8217;t listened to the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/wsg/audio/index.xml">podcast</a> yet so I&#8217;m just guessing at the moment but I could see <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">Drew&#8217;s</a> &#8220;Your website as your <span class="caps">API</span>&#8221; talk at the <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/10/21/following-the-wsg-microformats-event/">recent <span class="caps">WSG</span> meeting</a> making use of <span class="caps">XSLT</span>?</p>
 <p>So, I think I might have changed my mind a bit. <span class="caps">XSL</span>, I think, is going to be a useful skill to have in your toolkit in a world of microformats and APIs. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/">W3Schools <span class="caps">XSL</span> tutorial</a> is a pretty good starting place if you&#8217;ve not used it previously at all. Thought I&#8217;d still rather use a <a href="http://www.cheetahtemplate.org/">decent templating engine</a> for site rendering tasks.</p>

        Virtualhosts on Mac OS X
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2006</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com">Matthew</a> just posted a quick write up of <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/journal/378/virtual-hosts-and-the-proper-way-to-work-offline">setting up virtual hosts</a> on windows and a little of the rationale behind why you would bother.</p>
 <p>Being a Mac person when I&#8217;m not in the office I thought a quick follow up would be useful for those that way inclined.</p>
 <p>On OS X their are a couple of things needed to setup a virtual host. As well as the apache virtualhost directives the host needs adding to NetInfoManager.</p>
 <p>Although you can do all of this manually I&#8217;m more of a fan of a quick shell script and, as it happens, so are others. I&#8217;ve been using a modified version of <a href="http://patrickgibson.com/">Patrick Gibsons</a> <a href="http://patrickgibson.com/utilities/virtualhost/">Virtualhost&#8217;s script</a> for a while. Just drop it somewhere on your path (or run it from a specific folder) from Terminal like so:</p>
<div><code>sudo virtualhost.sh morethanseven.dev</code></div>
 <p>Where morethanseven.dev is the local domain you want setting up. The default version of the script makes the assumption that you are using the default web server which comes with OS X. I&#8217;m not, but it&#8217;s easy enough to modifiy the configuration parameters at the top of the (well commented) script to point where you want. I have it working perfectly with a copy of the <a href="http://www.mamp.info/"><span class="caps">MAMP</span></a> installation package for instance.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m something of a fan of utility scripts. Often repeated tasks can be bundled up into a shell script, python script or automator workflow. Automatic screen capture? Batch image processing? Backup? It can help keep everything tidy, as well as minimising repeated effort. Anyone else with any good examples of process automation with regards web design want to share?</p>

        The readability of our prose

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been doing a little more light weight analytical research, this time on the readability of the content I read in my feed reader, which mainly consists of web design and development blogs and magazines.</p>
 <p>A combination of things brough me to this point. An interest in accessibility and readability, being a maths and stats geek and my affair with Python. Yes, I know it&#8217;s just stats, and I did just parse the titles and descriptions from feeds once. I&#8217;m not claiming anything other than I though it interesting and worth sharing. If I get really carried away I&#8217;ll set up a league table.</p>
 <p>Who knows; maybe it will encourage some to use less dense prose? As long as people dont start competing for the highest scores!</p>
 <p>For more information on the background to some of these algorithms and what they mean have a read of <a href="http://juicystudio.com/services/readability.php">Jez&#8217;s excellent write up</a></p>

 <p>A few interesting things to note. I&#8217;m sure some parsing error or such has Juicy Studio scoring so highly!</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll hopefully get round to releasing the scripts once I finish a couple of other things off.</p>
