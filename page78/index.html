    <span class="post-date">17 Jul 2005</span>

    <p>Been a little busy with the new job but had chance to do a few behind the scenes bits and pieces, including:</p>
<ul>
 <li>valid and formatted feed</li>
  <li>blogroll from <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/projects/12">StripComments </a> project</li>
  <li>autocomplete on search box (type c, x or p)</li>
  <li>added <a href="http://www.textism.com">Textile</a> formatting for posts</li>
</ul>
 <p>Should be back with more soon. I need to reply to phil (<a href="http://xlab.co.uk">xlab</a>) about my musical preferences, jot down notes on using <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> as an online feed reader and a web standards redoing of the <a href="http://www.qwikiwiki.com">QWikiWiki</a> output layer that I&#8217;m part way through.</p>

    <p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</strong> Visiting the website I now find out that after the next mini issue it&#8217;s all over for Design in Flight. I can see how it could take over someone&#8217;s life considering the quality but I for one would have paid more to keep it around.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve just got round to buying all the back issues of Design in Flight (<a href="http://www.designinflight.com">www.designinflight.com</a>) magazine &#8211; which features articles on design, web development and similar fields.</p>
 <p>For only 10 dollars (via Pay Pal) for the 4 issues it seems excellent value at about 150 pages or so, brimming with interesting information.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve obviously not read that much as yet but so far so good and for the price you cant really go wrong.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jul 2005</span>

    <p>After a little work I&#8217;ve put together an app to keep up to date with all the news around @media. Based on the collection of feeds from <a href="http://kurafire.net">kurafire.net</a> it collects and filters for posts for @media references and displays them.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m hoping it will proove useful to anyone else who wants to keep up to date. Especially when details start coming up about next year and in the lead up to that.</p>
 <p>Have a look at <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia">morethanseven.net/atmedia</a>. If you have any more feeds just let me know &#8211; I want it to be as extensive as possible.</p>

    <p>I now have an <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> environment setup and ready to go and the will to use it. Depending on how it goes I&#8217;ll try and post any thoughts as I go. In particularly related to how I get on with good standards markup.</p>
 <p>I can knock together whatever I want in <span class="caps">PHP</span> reasonably well and with my new job focusing on <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">XHTML</span> amongst other related bits, and working at .<span class="caps">NET</span> shop I thought I now have a reason to play.</p>

        more from @media

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jun 2005</span>

    <p>With all the goings on off the back of @media its pretty hard to keep up. Many of the ideas that where discussed seem to be taking hold and coming into the world and lots of sites have had some recdent <span class="caps">TLC</span>. Anyway, here goes with a few observations.</p>
 <p><strong>Simplified Standards</strong><br />
Simplifiedstandards (<a href="http://www.simplifiedstandards.com/">simplifiedstandards.com</a>) looks like a great idea. A few people where discussing a central repository for concensus on issues of web standards application in the real world and this aims to be just that. Simon Collison of <a href="http://www.collylogic.com">www.collylogic.com</a> is bringing everything together as far as I can see.</p>
 <p><strong>Everyones thoughts</strong><br />
Faruk AteÃ…Å¸ appears to have spent every day since getting back compiling a list of what anyone anywhere said about the event. Its a great idea and makes finding peoples thoughts easier but I wonder if their would be an easy way of doing this (like pinging a web service with any new articles?) without one guy doing all the work?<br />
Look for everyones comments at <a href="http://www.kurafire.net/log/archive/2005/06/11/atmedia-2005-report">kurafire.net</a></p>
 <p><strong>Designersinhouse</strong><br />
One guy I did meet at the conference was Matt Patterson who has set up a small (but radidly growing) mainling list over at <a href="http://www.designersinhouse.com">www.designersinhouse.com</a> aimed at designers working within larger organisations. One thing I took away from the conference was the large number of people working outside service or agency environments.</p>
 <p>And that is just some of the goings on. A good amount of discussion going on around the level of legislation needed to govern accessibility doing the rounds, the <span class="caps">ATF</span> (Accessibility TaskForce) from WaSP just starting up with several of the speakers on board and god knows what else. Oh, and I still haven&#8217;t done a zoom layout but I did add some word completion to the search box!</p>
