        Archiving Twitter data with Python

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Nov 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://www.al3x.net/">Alex</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> just got round to adding the ability to export your entire archive of tweets via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation"><span class="caps">API</span></a>. A few people on the mailing list had been asking for this for a while so good to see it get released.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t resist knocking together a very quick and simple Python script to go off and get all your tweets, presented here for anyone else to play around with. Note that simple, fast and works on my machine were watchwords here. Don&#8217;t expect fancy parameters, much error handling or artificial intelligence.</p>
<% syntax_colorize :python, type=:coderay do %>
import urllib2
username = '<YOUR USERNAME>'
password = '<YOUR PASSWORD>'
format = 'json' # json or xml
filename = 'archive.json' # filename of the archive
tweets = 164 # number of tweets
pages = (int(float(tweets)/float(80)))+1
auth = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
auth.add_password(None, 'http://twitter.com/account/', username, password)
authHandler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(auth)
opener = urllib2.build_opener(authHandler)
urllib2.install_opener(opener) 
i = 1
response = ''
print 'Downloading tweets. Note that this may take some time'
while i <= pages:
    request = urllib2.Request('http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/account.' \
    + format + '?page=' + str(i))
    response = response + urllib2.urlopen(request).read()
    i = i + 1
handle = open(filename,"w")
handle.write(response)
handle.close()
print 'Archived ' + str(tweets) + ' of ' + username + \
'\'s tweets to ' + filename
<% end %>
<p>The main thing to note here though is the ideal of <a href="http://www.dataportability.org/">data portability</a>. Let&#8217;s just say I wanted to move to Jaiku or Pownce instead of Twitter, but didn&#8217;t want to lose all that data. If I can knock up an export script in half an hour then all you need are import data <span class="caps">API</span> calls and a little more scripting.</p>
<p>As it is, I&#8217;m more interesting in seeing what I can do with my data now I can get at it. <a href="http://suda.co.uk">Brian</a> just suggested a <a href="http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/">quick visualisation tool</a> (which already eats <span class="caps">JSON</span>) and I&#8217;d already been thinking about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/pygunfog/">language analysis</a> and maybe having a look at <a href="http://www.apml.org/"><span class="caps">APML</span></a> some more. Open data is simply more fun.</p>

        Should we just learn Java?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>As a wandering web designer cum developer and now occasional consultant I&#8217;m generally pretty technology agnostic. At some point or another I&#8217;ve written <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, Javascript, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, C#, Python and Rails for a living &#8211; often on the same day. But something has me thinking and I thought I&#8217;d see what other people thought as well.</p>
<p>That thing is <em>Java</em>. I have books on Java. I&#8217;ve done the usual examples (hello world in 20 lines for instance). I didn&#8217;t really like it and left it at that. But a few presentations, both from Google, at both <a href="http://future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> and <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> got me thinking. First you have <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> in the mobile space which Dave Burke did a good job of making look pretty interesting. Then you had the guys from <a href="http://ajaxian.com">Ajaxian</a> talking about using Java for <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">everything</a>.</p>
<p>A few other thinks to throw into the pot. <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Java-Bruce-Tate/dp/0596100949">Beyond Java</a> is an interesting read &#8211; summing up with a call for more fragmentation and for small nimble languages to be used where it makes sense. Oh, and I think <a href="http://tommorris.org/blog/">Tom</a> is busy learning Java as well. Mmmmm.</p>
<p>Some good coverage around of <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/ajaxising/">both</a> <a href="http://www.blackphoebe.com/msjen/2007/11/london-day-6-future.html#more">conferences</a> and I know my first impression was basically <em>this way lies madness</em>. But it would have been more interesting had their been a few more Java people around to argue with.</p>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m not advocating a Google like disregard for the web here. Markup really matters, I happen to disagree with <a href="http://crockford.com/">Douglas</a> and think <span class="caps">CSS</span> rocks and I love writing Javascript. But should we just learn Java anyhow and try to subvert some of the existing tools to be more web like?</p>

        Joost Developer Day
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>I spent yesterday afternoon over with <a href="http://joost.com">Joost</a> in London as part of their UK developer day. The event was mainly for them to show off their new widget platform and to get some input from prospective developers about what they would like to see next. About 20 people or so came along from the <span class="caps">BBC</span>, Ebay and a couple of london agencies, with me and <a href="http://tommorris.org/">Tom</a> loitering around the edges. The afternoon was split into a series of short talks from people on the team. What follows is some of the interesting bits.</p>
<p>Joost describe themselves as <em>The Best of the Internet and best of TV</em>, if you haven&#8217;t seen it yet it&#8217;s basically TV running on the Mozilla platform. All in all pretty impressive. <a href="http://danbri.org">Dan Brickley</a> had a different slant, seeing Joost as Web 2.0 +/- 1 <em>Built and extended with modern web technology, modern web attitude</em>. The idea of taking an unashamedly desktop piece of software and learning lessons from the web is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.joost.com">Joost development site</a> is now public, although not linked to from the main site as yet. Their is some documentation of the various APIs but we can expect more in the future, including some videos from the developer days in a development channel.</p>
<p>The main emphasis for developers at this moment was on overlays and widgets (<em>little bundles of web technology</em>) which integrate with the Joost client. We got a sneak peak (and a chat with some of the developers) of the first commercial Joost widget for Coca Cola &#8211; <a href="http://cokebubbles.com">Coke Bubbles</a> and <a href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/~ecemm/">Libby Miller</a> and <a href="http://jibbering.com">Jim Ley</a> showed off a few of the default widgets.</p>
<p>The most interesting bits from my point of view were to do with the technology. Joost has an interesting advantage as a platform being a single, dedicated client. No more cross browser testing here. They also keep  pretty close to trunk for Mozilla, which gives them quite a bit of CSS3 support too. You can also try out other new technologies not available in too many browsers yet: <span class="caps">SVG</span>, <span class="caps">RDF</span>, Canvas and E4X for example. This was the second time in a few days I&#8217;d seen <span class="caps">SVG</span> pushed as cool, the first being at Future of Mobile which I&#8217;ll jot down some thoughts on later.</p>
<p>What was interesting was that the people along from the development team came from a W3C background rather than say an product development or design companies. Joost makes extensive use of Semantic Web technologies under the hood and exposes quite a bit of RDFa if you go looking for it. It also follows along with various other web-like ideas, unique URLs for channels and programmes, including the ability to pass these parameters for instance to deep link into a video at a current time. The widget platform as well is starting to align with standards work going on at the W3C &#8211; we saw a quick demo of a widget build for the Opera browser which worked seamlessly with Joost too. The development team are now working on dealing with signed widgets, local storage APIs, interwidget communication, as well as usable, clear privacy models. All pretty interesting.</p>
<p>Some of the event was hampered by a shoddy internet connection but the general mood was relaxed and friendly and no one seemed to mind too much. The beer probably helped. I did chuckle when a senior alternative marketing guy from Coke described as <em>Insane</em> the typical agency setup though (rich guy in Notting Hill &#8594; account manager &#8594; project manager &#8594; developers).</p>
<p>Their will be a Coke sponsored widget competition announced after the rest of the developer days (in Amsterdam and New York) with the title of <em>International widgets champion of Joost</em> up for grabs along with some cash and <em>a t-shirt</em>.</p>
<p>My only real complaint was probably the low level mutterings about Javascript! Audience members and Joost developers alike made a couple of digs during the course of the day. Javascript rocks, people. Oh well, I&#8217;m back in London for <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax">@media Ajax</a> where I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll have that problem.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds interesting (or you just want to watch more TV) I&#8217;d recommend having a look through the <a href="http://dev.joost.com">development site</a>, jumping on the joost-dev freenode <span class="caps">IRC</span> channel, signing up to the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/joost-dev">mailing list</a> or reading the <a href="http://blogs.joost.com/dev">development teams blog</a>.</p>

        Some useful mobile web design links
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2007</span>

    <p>Earlier in the year I set aside some time to get my head into the mobile web. Most of this was reading and tinkering. Since then I&#8217;ve pointed a number of people (including clients and people in the pub) towards some or all of the following links. A good starting point for anyone starting to get interested in the mobile web.</p>
<p>A good starting place is <a href="http://mobilewebbook.com/">Mobile Web Design</a> by Cameron Moll which is available as a <span class="caps">PDF</span>, and now as a <a href="http://www.lulu.com/content/1281648">hard copy from lulu</a>. Definitely worth your while. If you&#8217;re not convinced then you can read the <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000398.html">original series of articles</a> to get started.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/mobile-bp">Mobile Web Best Practices 1.0</a> from the W3C Mobile Web Initiative and <a href="http://www.passani.it/gap">Global Authoring Practices for the Mobile Web</a> are more good starting points, this time with more of an implementation focus. <a href="http://www.blueflavor.com/">Blue Flavor</a> also have an intersting presentation you can download on the subject of <a href="http://www.blueflavor.com/presentations/DesigningforMobile.pdf">Designing for Mobile</a></p>
<p>Once you have a basic understanding, or if you just want <em>the facts</em> then check out <a href="http://www.thewirelessfaq.com/">The Wireless <span class="caps">FAQ</span></a>. Everything from <a href="http://www.thewirelessfaq.com/in_short_what_is_wap">What is <span class="caps">WAP</span>?</a> up to <a href="http://www.thewirelessfaq.com/nokia_s60_wap_browser_cursor_skip_some_links_on_my_wap_site_what_is_wrong">Nokia S60 <span class="caps">WAP</span> browser cursor skip some links on my <span class="caps">WAP</span> site! What is wrong?</a> is in there somewhere.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re too busy to be reading everything written about mobile, or just prefer listening to the voice of <a href="http://www.boagworld.com/">Paul Boag</a>, then have a listen to <a href="http://www.boagworld.com/archives/2007/10/show_96_moll_on_mobile.html">Boagworld episode 96</a>. Heidi Pollock at the recent <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps</a> was also excellent, especially if you let your numbers. You can get the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/heidipollock/heidi-pollock-fowa-07/">presentation</a> and <a href="http://cdn.libsyn.com/carsonsystems/heidi_pollock.mp3">audio</a> of the talk now.</p>
<p>If you have still have questions after reading a few good articles or books then their are a couple of high quality mailing lists, namely <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/wmlprogramming/">wmlprogramming</a> and <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/mobiledesign/">mobiledesign</a>. It&#8217;s worth being subscribed to both, thought their is quite a bit of audience cross over.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://mtld.mobi">.mobi site</a> also has lots of useful information regarding mobile. Whether you buy into the need for a new top level domain or not it&#8217;s worth reading.</p>
<p>Lots of reading to get you started and not one mentioned of the iPhone&#8230;</p>
<p>Have any other good links for getting started in the mobile web? Leave a comment with further suggestions.</p>
