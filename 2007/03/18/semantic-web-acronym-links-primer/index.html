  <h1 class="post-title">Semantic Web acronym links primer</h1>
  <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2007</span>
  <p>One thing you hit pretty rapidly when you start having a look into all this Semantic Web malarkey is the number of rather <em>silly</em> acronyms and abbreviations. In fairness it&#8217;s true of pretty much every technical or academic discipline I&#8217;ve come across and you can ask the people I work with what I think about that &#8211; I wont ramble on here.</p>
<p>And dont think this is all because I&#8217;m not technical enough for ya, I have code on my blog and a faintly scary collection of technical tomes. I just think acronyms tend to breed elitism and make the world less penetrable, especially when they are often described in relation to other acronyms. So, after pointing out a problem here&#8217;s a stab at a solution; a web designers guide (with the relevant links) to my understanding of the different things involved. I&#8217;m not an expert on this yet mind, so if I&#8217;m wrong and someone more knowlegable can provide a better description then please comment. If the descriptions from the relevant links I have are good enough I&#8217;ll just use those as well.</p>
<p>Most people will probably have come across <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><span class="caps">XML</span></a> so hopefully this is an easy one. <span class="caps">XML</span> is the eXtensible Markup Language. For me that means it&#8217;s a set of rules for defining your own markup language; from simple data exchange formats to whole programming languages. The W3C says (which I think nicely highlights my problem from above)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (<span class="caps">XML</span>) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from <span class="caps">SGML</span> (<span class="caps">ISO</span> 8879)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt"><span class="caps">XSLT</span></a> is another quite common tool. The W3C again defines it in relation to another acronym but this time I dont mind as much and we&#8217;ve got a defintion of <span class="caps">XML</span> here anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<span class="caps">XSLT</span> is] a language for transforming <span class="caps">XML</span> documents into other <span class="caps">XML</span> documents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty straighforward description, the only real problem for the outsider is wondering why you would want to do that!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/rdf/default.asp">W3Schools says</a> is really where the Semantic Web stuff starts. The W3C start off with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Resource Description Framework (<span class="caps">RDF</span>) integrates a variety of application&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. It integrates applications&#8230; What! But wait:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">RDF</span> specifications provide a lightweight ontology system to support the exchange of knowledge on the Web</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty good actually, as long as you&#8217;re happy with the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">ontology</a>. Their is a <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf1.html">good article</a> that takes a stab at the question from Tim Bray. I think, simply put, <span class="caps">RDF</span> is common set of rules for defining your own meta data (information about information) so it&#8217;s interopable with everyone else doing the same thing.</p>
<p>But how are we going to get all that <span class="caps">RDF</span> into our web pages (Semantic or otherwise)? <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> is one possibility (not going there right now) which involves extending <span class="caps">HTML</span> (all varieties) with some additional attributes with the purpose of being able to embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in the document. Or from the W3C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RDFa is a syntax that expresses this structured data using a set of elements and attributes that embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in <span class="caps">HTML</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-grddl-20040413/"><span class="caps">GRDDL</span></a> is probably the worst offender here in terms of someone spending too much time coming up with the acronym. It stands for <em>Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages</em>. From looking it appears to be a standard way of saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here be some <span class="caps">RDF</span>. If you want the <span class="caps">RDF</span> for this document please use this <span class="caps">XSL</span> transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml">eRDF</a>, or embedded <span class="caps">RDF</span> is a simpler approach to RDFa which involves no additional custom attributes but does not aim to be able to represent all the possible <span class="caps">RDF</span> constructs.</p>
<p>Of course their are many more, but at least that&#8217;s a start. Let me know what you think.</p>
