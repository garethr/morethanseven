  <p>Performance used to be something other people thought about. If you were working on a high traffic site for a large company, chances are they would throw inordinate amounts of expensive hardware at the problem. If you had a personal site only if you got really popular would you need more than a shared host. But the number of web applications being launched by small companies or individuals from their bedrooms is raising the awareness of the importance of performant websites.</p>
<p>Credit to <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! here. Google and Amazon might be the first companies that spring to mine when it comes to thinking about infrastructure but <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! have been publishing lots of useful, practical and interesting information in this area. <a href="http://stevesouders.com/">Steve Souders</a>, the Chief Performance <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>! has a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/o/ASIN/0596529309/">new book</a> going into detail about <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!s performance rules</a>. The recent release of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/">YSlow</a> extension and another <a href="http://website-performance.org/">upcoming book</a> from <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2007/09/27/css-sprite-generator-tool/">Stuart Colville</a> and <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/">Ed Eliot</a> cap things off nicely.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#num_http"><span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Combined files are a way to reduce the number of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests by combining all scripts into a single script, and similarly combining all stylesheets into a single stylesheet. It&#8217;s a simple idea that hasn&#8217;t seen wide adoption. The ten top U.S. web sites average 7 scripts and 2 stylesheets per page. Combining files is more challenging when the scripts and stylesheets vary from page to page, but making this part of your release process improves response times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While all that has been going on I&#8217;ve been working with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project and come across a great plugin; <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/pages/asset_packager">asset_packager</a> from <a href="http://synthesis.sbecker.net/">Scott Becker</a>. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/webapps/serving-javascript-fast">Vitamin article</a> by <a href="http://www.iamcal.com/">Cal Henderson</a> (of Flickr and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Building-Scalable-Web-Sites-Henderson/dp/0596102356">another good book</a> fame), asset_packager compresses and merges <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript based on a prescribed configuration.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also working on a few <span class="caps">PHP</span> projects and wanted the same experience in these as well, so  I&#8217;ve gone a put together a quick release of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/">php asset packager</a>. At the moment this is a <span class="caps">CSS</span> only release, with Javascript features coming later, along with all the rest of the features of the Rails plugin and anything else I can think of or need.</p>
<p>First off you define your stylesheet setup. I used <a href="http://www.yaml.org/"><span class="caps">YAML</span></a> as my goal was to stick as close as possible to the Rails plugin.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;stylesheets:
- base:
  - screen
  - header
- secondary:
  - foo
  - bar&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The above simply states that you want to merge screen and header <span class="caps">CSS</span> files together to form a base stylesheet, and merge foo and bar together to create a secondary <span class="caps">CSS</span> file.</p>
<p>All you then have to do is include the following:</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;// define("ENVIRONMENT", "production");</p>
<p>echo Asset_packager::stylesheet_link_merged();</pre></code></p>
<p>If the <span class="caps">ENVIRONMENT</span> constant is set to <em>production</em> the line includes the merged stylesheet links, otherwise each file is included seperately. This again mirrors the behaviour of the Rails plugin. A command line script is also included in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager/source">source</a> to actually merge (and <a href="http://csstidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a>) the <span class="caps">CSS</span> files.</p>
<p>The vague plan is to add the rest of the features and then maybe package up as a plugin for whatever software or frameworks I&#8217;m working with at the time. At the moment that probably means wordpress, <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">symfony</a> and <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">code igniter</a>. Everything is open source and available from svn over on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/php-asset-packager">Google Code site</a>. Contributions, in the way of code, bugs, documentation or thoughts welcome.</p>
