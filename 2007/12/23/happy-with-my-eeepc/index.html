  <p>I like small. I have a macbook rather than a macbook pro because it&#8217;s smaller. Especially now I&#8217;m wandering about more often with work (and play) lugging a machine around is less and less appealing. So, armed with that excuse I felt justified in going out and buying a new <a href="http://eeepc.asus.com">Asus Eee PC</a>. I managed to just walk in to <a href="www.microanvika.com/">Micro Anvika</a> in Newcastle and buy one from a bemused staff member who  was pretty shocked to find one in stock and not allocated (sorry <a href="http://www.reyhan.org/">Rey</a>).</p>
<p>For anyone who hasn&#8217;t seen one before, the Eee PC is a tiny linux laptop a little like the One Laptop Per Child machine but aimed more at traditional computer users (at the moment read <em>early adopting geeks</em>). The distro is setup to be pretty user friendly for those pesky Windows users but a little hacking turns it into a pretty darn nice machine.</p>

<p>And yes, I have stuck an apple sticker on back. I&#8217;m sure that should get some entertained looks next time I&#8217;m at a relevant event! I think the machine itself is actually pretty good looking, but the default desktop themes are all pretty uninspiring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve stuck with the appliance like IceWM window manager and the launcher application as it makes starting things up from the keyboard with one hand pretty fast. I then jumped into various hidden away files to get the desktop setup how I like. The <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com">wiki</a> over on <a href="http://eeeuser.com">eee user</a> has a number of useful tutorials; <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:customizeeasymode">customising easy mode</a> and the debian repo from <a href="http://wiki.eeeuser.com/howto:installruby">a ruby tutorial</a> were particularly handy.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgEeepcDesktop.jpg" title="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" alt="Minimal IceWM desktop with Asus Launcher" /></p>
<p>Still lots more I could install (this is Linux after all) but so far have installed Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Erlang, MySQL, SQLite, Apache2, PHP5, <span class="caps">PEAR</span> and symfony all without a hitch. I do love apt when it just works. I&#8217;ll try and get Mono and Java on their as well just for completeness when I get a moment.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of that I&#8217;ll really miss at the moment is Keynote. It has a <span class="caps">VGA</span> out port (which not even the macbook has) which will support a decent resolution for presentations. But Keynote is so pretty and easy to use compared to the alternatives. We&#8217;ll have to see next time I have to do a presentation.</p>
<p>I can see lots of places (past the obsessive tech geeks like me) where a machine like this will be really interesting. Obviously the low cost of the machine means that schools might just get interested in Linux. For people who prefer a desktop machine as their main computer and only occasionally need a laptop it&#8217;s a pretty cost effective option. As a machine to experiment with Linux it&#8217;s pretty useful too &#8211; I&#8217;d recommend being familiar with basic commands on Linux to anyone doing web development work for instance. With so many possible audiences, and what is already a pretty nice machine, Asus might be onto something here.</p>
