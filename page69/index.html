    <p>I&#8217;ve been going along to the local industry do <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> for a good long while now and they have talked me into speaking at the next do. So I wont be thinking for the first hour, rather rambling on about the chosen topic of Web 2.0. My loose plan is to mock the term and big up the technology involved. Someone else has the job of looking at the business implications, which should also be pretty interesting.</p>
 <p>Apparently this is me:</p>
 <p>Gareth works at TH_NK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a newcastle based brand technology company. He is involved in a number of areas of the web design and development process, from the design of modern web applications to building effective online interfaces. In his spare time, he blogs on web design, development and accessibility at <a href="http://morethanseven.net">morethanseven.net</a> and organises events for the local developer community on <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a>. Keeping up-to-speed with web trends and new technology is something Gareth is passionate about Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it shows.</p>
 <p>If anyone who has never been before, or isn&#8217;t a <a href="http://codeworks.net">codeworks</a> member, wants to go along then let me know. I&#8217;m sure Heather would love more people along, and be good to see some familiar faces (or at least familiar domain names) in the audience.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll publish my brief presentation if it&#8217;s any good after the event. See you there?</p>

    <p>I dont often ramble about accessibility issues on here, something I&#8217;ve only just noticed. Quite suprising as it&#8217;s one of those things that I&#8217;m pretty interested in &#8211; and have been for a good long time.</p>
 <p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve just finished reading through <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/ICT/PAS78/index.xalter"><span class="caps">PAS</span> 78</a> or Publicly Available Specification 78, Guide to Good Practice in Commissioning Accessible Websites. It&#8217;s a document aimed at those buying websites, especially in the public sector, who probably know accessibility is <em>a good think</em> but could get easily hoodwinked by anyone with even a modicum of knowledge and evil intentions.</p>
 <p>Rather than just provide information about the what and why, considering the doc was launched a month ago, I&#8217;ll just point you to <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/access/Pas78Launch">a good synopsis</a> from <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk">Isolani</a>. A few other notables have posted good reads. <a href="http://joeclark.org/">Joe Clark</a>, as always, has <a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2006/03/21/pas78/">an opinion</a> which is both anally detailed and all true. <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce</a> also has a <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/pas78">run down</a> from a (some what) insiders point of view.</p>
 <p>My feeling was, overall, pretty positive. I&#8217;d love to see all the clients I deal with having read this. It&#8217;s a pretty good intro to the issues at hand, though it is maybe a little long and technical for some of its audience. One area in particular that got quite a bit of coverage, rightly so in my mind, was testing. Their still isn&#8217;t enough testing of any sorts for websites, even with all these <em>beta</em>  tags going around. The testing area covers all sorts of bits and pieces, again not in enough detail for the implementor but certainly enough for any good procurement office to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
 <p>A good series of mentions goes to <a href="http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/13407stds.htm"><span class="caps">ISO</span> 13407</a> which covers Human centred design processes for interactive systems and as luck would have it the subject of a workshop I&#8217;m attending with <a href="http://osiris.sunderland.ac.uk/~cs0gco/">Gilbert</a> in Sunderland on monday. More on that after the fact.</p>
 <p>Anyhow. I&#8217;d recommend getting your bosses to pay the Ã‚Â£30 (or for bosses, stump up your selves) for the <span class="caps">PAS</span> 78 <span class="caps">PDF</span>. It&#8217;s a pretty good read anyhow, and hopefully more and more proper clients will be reading it soon. Forewarned is forearmed as they say.</p>

        Playing with Python - first impressions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>Ok, well not quite first impressions. I&#8217;ve dabbled before but not for a particular reason and never actually built anything &#8211; but I&#8217;ve spent most of today getting stuck into <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
 <p>I have a couple of reasons for wanting to learn another language properly, and I&#8217;m more interested in Python as a general scripting language than as a replacement for <span class="caps">PHP</span> as my web language of choice (Rails hasn&#8217;t really caught me  yet, sorry). I could do some of this with <span class="caps">PHP</span> I know but that brings me to my second reason. I&#8217;ve been reading the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">Pragmatic Programmer</a> recently and one of the things it has to say is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Learn at least one new [programming] language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut.&#8221; <br />
The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>I like the idea of that. The rest of the book has a number of interesting things to say about programming in general, much of which is easily actionable.</p>
 <p>A few of my <a href="http://kryogenix.org/">regular</a> <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">reads</a> sing occasionally about the joys of Python, which was probably another reason I&#8217;ve gone that way as well.</p>
 <p>Anyway, first impressions is that Python is pretty easy to pick up. I keep wanting to put in braces and semi-colons but looking at the code it looks clean, simple and readable. Arrays, string functions and flow control appear to be present and correct. They work how you would expect which is what you want really for core functionality. Objects are next on my list of things to look at.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m building a simple log file analysis tool as I go. I&#8217;m fine with it being a command line app to be honest, but I might end up tinkering with some of the <span class="caps">GUI</span> features at a later date. One of the reasons for going for Python was it&#8217;s flexibility in this regard. Hopefully building something as I go will make it more likely that I&#8217;ll keep playing. I have a couple of other sample apps I&#8217;d like to make as well which is probably a good thing again to maintain interest.</p>
 <p>Anyway, depending on how things go some more comments or code may emerge. Anyone else taking similar advice to learn new languages? If so which ones?</p>

        The Wisdom of Clouds
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m playing with a few thinks at the moment and one of those had me thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">tag clouds</a>. For those who dont spend time on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> or similar you may not have seen then, or at least heard of the terminology. All we are really taking about here is a visually weighted list.</p>
 <p>I dont agree with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0505a.shtml">Jeffrey here</a> unfortunately, who has issues. I can see the point, that sometimes information is better organised by one person than many (think your weekly food shopping list) but in some cases it can be nice &#8211; especially where it provides an alternative navigation method. Maybe I just missed the part where everyone had a tag cloud? I&#8217;d love to see, for instance, a tag cloud on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> of bands that I might like based on my listening habits, and those of a similar musical persuasion.</p>
 <p>An <a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/second_generation_tag_clouds.html">interesting article</a> on where next for tags clouds throws up a few interesting points but one thing I have not seen discussed at all is the accessibility angle. Visual prominence is one thing, but without some sort of semantic prominence those not viewing the content visually lose out. A very unscientific survery involving the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">del.icio.us tag cloud</a> confirmed what I though would probably be the case &#8211; the visual effects (ie. bigger or highlighted text) are implemented purely via classes on the links.</p>
 <p>What would be the effect of using plain links, moving to <em>emphasis</em> for the next level, up to <strong>strong</strong> for the really important tags? We can style the content exactly the same as before, but we have added some sematic prominence to the content.</p>
 <p>Anyone had any experience implementing tag clouds in live projects? Even better, anyone had experience of user testing such interface devices? Real bonus points for accessibility related testing.</p>
