        The Wisdom of Clouds

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m playing with a few thinks at the moment and one of those had me thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">tag clouds</a>. For those who dont spend time on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> or similar you may not have seen then, or at least heard of the terminology. All we are really taking about here is a visually weighted list.</p>
 <p>I dont agree with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0505a.shtml">Jeffrey here</a> unfortunately, who has issues. I can see the point, that sometimes information is better organised by one person than many (think your weekly food shopping list) but in some cases it can be nice &#8211; especially where it provides an alternative navigation method. Maybe I just missed the part where everyone had a tag cloud? I&#8217;d love to see, for instance, a tag cloud on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> of bands that I might like based on my listening habits, and those of a similar musical persuasion.</p>
 <p>An <a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/second_generation_tag_clouds.html">interesting article</a> on where next for tags clouds throws up a few interesting points but one thing I have not seen discussed at all is the accessibility angle. Visual prominence is one thing, but without some sort of semantic prominence those not viewing the content visually lose out. A very unscientific survery involving the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">del.icio.us tag cloud</a> confirmed what I though would probably be the case &#8211; the visual effects (ie. bigger or highlighted text) are implemented purely via classes on the links.</p>
 <p>What would be the effect of using plain links, moving to <em>emphasis</em> for the next level, up to <strong>strong</strong> for the really important tags? We can style the content exactly the same as before, but we have added some sematic prominence to the content.</p>
 <p>Anyone had any experience implementing tag clouds in live projects? Even better, anyone had experience of user testing such interface devices? Real bonus points for accessibility related testing.</p>

        Reading up on a speedy industry
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>I had cause today to stop and think about books relevant to learning the bigger picture side of building web sites and applications. Code, graphic design, whatever your bag in between, you are either aiming to become, will become or at least affected by people in management positions. Even small companies are not immune, though they can avoid some of the problems (but often by causing some other ones as well.)</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of books, I read lots online but when it comes to regular, night after night reading I much prefer to be in bed with a book than a laptop. I have no problem at all falling asleep and the book falling lightly on the floor for the morning.</p>
 <p>Books do however date, or rather some do, or maybe if you take them as gospel they do. Anyhow, I see them as useful &#8211; perhaps even more so in distilling knowledge for consumption by other, less obsessive, members of out industry?</p>
 <p>Without further ado I present a short(ish) list of books I think everyone involved in web software should read:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514047">Ship It!: A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001088">The Cathedral &#38; the Bazaar</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735713286">Web Design on a Shoestring</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712026">Return on Design: Smarter Web Design for Hard Times </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018">Designing with Web Standards</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723700">The Art and Science of Web Design</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735714339">Web Redesign Workflow that Works</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Some are most definately on the software side, others very web centric while more still are a little older and just plain odd. However all of them serve a purpose, they let people see into a way of thinking. The idea that programmers are <em>wizards</em> annoys me. It&#8217;s not magic, it&#8217;s creativity, just with tools most people are not familiar with.</p>
 <p>If you are someone involved with the building of appications give some of the above a try if you ever feel like reading up on something different, apart from the latest <a href="http://cssmastery.com"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a> or <a href="http://domscripting.com/">Javascript</a> tricks.</p>
 <p>If your involved in the management of projects but come from a non software (dont kid yourself because it&#8217;s the web it&#8217;s not software) background then dive in. You&#8217;ll start to understand some of the little bits that puzzle you so.</p>
 <p>Anyone else got any books in a similar vein? I&#8217;m always on the look out for an interesting read. Or do you complely disagree &#8211; do you even still read books?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve finally decided that <a href="http://pear.php.net"><span class="caps">PEAR</span></a> is a good thing. For those unfamiliar with it it&#8217;s a little like <span class="caps">CPAN</span> for Perl. For those unfamiliar with <em>that</em> it&#8217;s a repository of high quality <span class="caps">PHP</span> code, covering everything from benchmarking and debugging to database abstraction.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m about to dive back into <span class="caps">PHP</span> after a minor break playing with mainly client side toys, and with my work now mainly on the markup/styles and planning side of things <span class="caps">PHP</span> is a nice break. <strong><span class="caps">PHP</span> isn&#8217;t the devil</strong> as far as I&#8217;m concerned, and I think now I&#8217;ve grown up <span class="caps">PEAR</span> is part of the non devil like side to <span class="caps">PHP</span> &#8211; the professional side if you will.</p>
 <p>I like <span class="caps">PHP</span> for it&#8217;s flexibility. The same problems this causes in terms of it being easy to write poor, unmaintainable code are the same boons in brings if you use it nicely. I dont want static typing, on occasion being able to get down and dirty with procedural code is handy and with so much <em>good</em> code out there in places like <span class="caps">PEAR</span> it&#8217;s often very quick to put together something from existing parts.</p>
 <p>I even went as far as getting a book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590592808/104-7139045-1616718?v=glance&#38;n=283155"><span class="caps">PHP</span> Tools</a> to have a good going through. I&#8217;ve been on something of a mad web design book shopping spree of late, so I&#8217;ll try do a quick round up of books soon as well.</p>
 <p>Anyone else have much playtime with <span class="caps">PEAR</span>, or similar code repositories?</p>

        keyboards and web applications
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>Web applications are still evolving. This we know. One thing any power user tends to pick up on pretty quickly in desktop applications is the keyboard shortcuts. We just cant get enought of them. Why dont we see them more in web applications? Well a couple of reasons as it happens:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Potential clashes with browser or OS shortcuts</li>
  <li>Many web applications are still evolving from more promotional websites. The learning curve for a website <em>needs</em> to be instantaneous, otherwise your potential customer just left. But what about a web application? The users may <em>have</em> to use it, as well as having documentation and maybe even training.</li>
  <li>Because we dont see them in web applications? The circular argument.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Personally I think in some cases keyboard shortcuts would be nice, I have a little plan for something in mind as well so started experimenting. The clash issue I&#8217;m going to leave for another post as it will take a bit of brute force experimenting but I did start playing with a simple way of assigning functions to keys.</p>
 <p>The following code creates an object to store the lookup/hash/two dimensional array (pick one you like). This is a simple associate between a key, and a function to run when it&#8217;s pressed. A function is then assigned to the onkeyup and onkeydown events which monitors them, checks for one of the keys in the lookup to be pressed (in this case along with the ctrl key) and runs the assigned function.</p>
<div>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;txp:php&amp;gt;
include('/www/htdocs/morethanseven/scripts/sample/keyPress.js');
&amp;lt;/txp:php&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
</div>
 <p>A simple library function is used to add the event to the document onload. My library obviously includes other helper functions but we dont need any of those for this example.</p>
<div>
<p><code>
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;txp:php&amp;gt;
include('/www/htdocs/morethanseven/scripts/sample/lib.js'); 
&amp;lt;/txp:php&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></p>
</div>
 <p>Some improvements I can spot from here which I&#8217;ll implement as I actually take this out of the lab and into something production like.</p>
<ul>
 <li><span class="caps">JSON</span> (or <span class="caps">YAML</span>) data storage. Either one makes configuration simpler and scores geek points. It&#8217;s a win win.</li>
  <li>Abstract the use of the ctrl key from the function and allow other modifiers to be set when used.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I&#8217;ll try get round to the look at keyboard shortcut clashes, or link to someone who already has, as I get round to it. In the mean time, what do people think about the use of keyboard shortcuts in web applications? Any good or bad examples welcome.</p>

        Last Week with Ajax
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Feb 2006</span>

    <p>Last friday I got the chance to stick around in London and attend the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> Ajax workshop with <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith</a>. 30 people from different web disciplines and backgrounds trying to get as much out of a single day on the latest buzz word has to sound like fun?</p>
 <p>I had heard Jeremy&#8217;s speak before at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> last year where he was one of the highlights and friday was much of the same. In a good way. Clear, to the point, explanations. Examples where they help to make a point, some wry humour and the odd culinary simile. The only real let down there was he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/adactio/96454214/">cut his hair short</a>. This tendency for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andybudd/98405129/in/pool-summit2006/">minimalism in hair cuts</a>  amongst <a href="http://htmldog.com">web designers</a> is disturbing me. Only <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/andybudd/98405572/in/pool-summit2006/">Norm</a> can <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">save us now</a>.</p>
 <p>Back on topic the day covered everything from theory and first principals to some fully working examples, but stuck with playing with Javascript and code from scratch, rather than frameworks and server side stuff. A descision I think really made the day useful.</p>
 <p>The morning was, to be fair, less useful from my standpoint. The speed introduction to Javascript, and some of the concepts of Ajax where covering ground I&#8217;d already covered personally. That&#8217;s not to say they weren&#8217;t well placed or interesting though, far from it, and did provide some people with what was probably the best crash course in Javascript imaginable.</p>
 <p>The afternoon really kicked into gear though. Lots of examples; from simple updating content through to making use of the Yahoo <span class="caps">API</span>. Throw in some examples with server side code, the obligatory shopping basket example and, particularly impressive, a detailed look at <span class="caps">JSON</span>. This all in one afternoon remember.</p>
 <p>The code examples we got to take away with, and much of this was generic enough to have already found it&#8217;s way into my working library. I&#8217;m very much a fan of Jeremy&#8217;s <span class="caps">DIY</span> ethic with regards Javascript. I too am sceptical of using huge frameworks to crack nuts without a clue about what they are doing. The actual simplicity of the Ajax methods I think was one thing that Jeremy got over better than anyone I&#8217;ve listened to date. It really is about application design more than new, fancy, complex technology.</p>
 <p>A few other people who attended have posted <a href="http://www.molly.com/2006/02/17/jeremy-keith-and-the-truth-about-ajax/">their</a> <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/index.php/2006/ajax-hijax-and-accessibility/">opinions</a> .<em>I&#8217;m really not stalking Molly by the way</em>.</p>
 <p>As Molly had hinted, Jermey is also very quotable. So here are a few of the things I&#8217;m sure he said, any loss of context here is completely my fault though:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The validator is my friend</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>What&#8217;s the problem? Reality! (refering to IE)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="caps">DOM</span> is like a scalpel, innerHTML is like a sledgehammer!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>It&#8217;s hard to argue with one line of code (on innerHTML vs <span class="caps">DOM</span>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Pointing at Google maps as an example of Ajax is like pointing at a ferari on a race course as an example of the combustion engine. You spend most of your time going wow!</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>We closed up the afternoon with some discussion of the accessibility concerns, some of the development issues (wireframing ajax apps anyone?) and a whistle stop look at frameworks. All in all a very useful day, both personally (ie. I had fun) and professionally (I think my employer got value for money.) It also reinforced what I&#8217;ve been thinking more and more recently. It&#8217;s nearly all about design when it comes to real work. <em>When</em> and <em>where</em> and <em>why</em> must come first, and <em>how</em> is often more trivial than you think.</p>
