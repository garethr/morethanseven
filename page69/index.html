    <p>Help! I&#8217;m not sure what to do? I appear to have been set upon by nearly published author <a href="http://collylogic.com">simon</a> in an attempt to spread a deadly meme. Oh well.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m something of an avid reader and, making use of the nice <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> <span class="caps">API</span> I&#8217;ll try to keep my reading list up to date on here. I&#8217;m just including books that are maybe a little relevant to the web &#8211; otherwise this will get out of hand. I&#8217;d like to include some brief reviews if the time ever comes along, though dont hold your breath.</p>

        A Foundation to Build Javascript On

    <span class="post-date">22 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>Like probably quite a few others I&#8217;m doing more Javascript of late, both professionally and at play. It&#8217;s not just the whole buzz around it, all the way back to <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">using Javascript for Good not Evil</a> but I moved away from doing backend development when I moved jobs, Javascript is most definately in my client side job remit.</p>
 <p>As an <a href="http://morethanseven.net/books">avid reader</a> I&#8217;ve got hold of  a few <a href="http://domscripting.com/book/">good quality</a> <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/dhtml1/">Javascript books</a> that have come along and was on the lookout for more when I came upon <a href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=10042">Foundations of <span class="caps">AJAX</span></a> from <a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress&#8217;s</a> black and yellow experts voice series. I haven&#8217;t read enough to give a full conclusion but I&#8217;ve been impressed with other books in the series and it looks promising so far. A few chapters did stand out (I jumped in and read them first) that had little to do with <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, concentrating instead on setting up a proper Javascript development environment.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m not a fan of bloated IDEs so the lack of one for Javascript doesn&#8217;t bother me as much as it does some. However debugging by browser is a pain for simple scripts, never mind larger applications. Firefox&#8217;s Javascript Console is mighty handy here, as is the <span class="caps">DOM</span> inspector and the <a href="http://jennifermadden.com/scripts/ViewRenderedSource.html">view rendered source</a> extension. There is also the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=2f465be0-94fd-4569-b3c4-dffdf19ccd99&#38;DisplayLang=en">Windows Script Debugger</a> but I personally haven&#8217;t had much luck with that as yet.</p>
 <p>Projects should have documentation and code should have comments. But it&#8217;s time consuming (honestly). Automatic generation of docs from source comments both makes you comment more efficiently and comprehensively <em>and</em> saves time. Everyone&#8217;s happy, at least as long as they are using the <a href="http://jsdoc.sourceforge.net/">JSDoc</a> perl application to do just that. Anyone familiar with Java will have come across JDoc and the name isn&#8217;t the only similarity. It&#8217;s now installed and ready to be used next time I write any Javascript.</p>
 <p>Another area of interest recently has been application design, analysis and methodology, so I&#8217;d come across the idea of <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html">test driven development</a> before and experimented briefly &#8211; but not with Javascript. The idea is that you write tests that can be run automatically on your finished code before you write the code, it makes you <em>design</em> more which cant be a bad think. Anyway, Javascript has <a href="http://www.edwardh.com/jsunit/">JSUnit</a>, a nice unit testing framework. Again, installed and ready to give it a whirl.</p>
 <p>Hopefully this brief list will prove useful to anyone else making more use of Javascript recently and looking to be more productive. Anyone else with any other useful tools do post a comment, or is their a mythical application that you just wish existed to help you with your Javascript woes?</p>

        Music and Web Standards sitting in a tree
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">17 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve quite a music fan, I used to be more so but have been catching up recently with various bits and pieces. I tend to stick with more web centric posts on here but, while loading lots of music into iTunes I thought what the hell. I&#8217;ll touch on a few points of web goodness just in case.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve noted quite a strong link between music and web standards style blogs for a while. Lots of <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/12/top_10_albums_i_bought_in_2005/">end of year posts</a> touched on music and <a href="http://collylogic.com">simon</a> even has his <a href="http://www.collylogic.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/music_monthlies_november_2005">music monthlies</a> My guess here is that the amount of time spent on the computer (both in and out of work) and a tendency to be male tends to lead to some musical interest or other. Having said that alot of the same bands seem to crop up as well. It seems to be lots of indie, newish brit popesque, garagish bands. Guitars. Men. That sort of thing.</p>
 <p>A number of other instances spring to mind. A discussion a long while back on <a href="http://designersinhouse.com">designersinhouse</a> about listening to music at work, <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy Keith&#8217;s</a> in a <a href="http://www.saltercane.com/">real band</a> and visiting a certain Rock night after an <a href="http://accessifyforum.com">accessify</a> meetup with <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a> a few months back.</p>
 <p>Where is all the music related web software produced by all of these people though? <a href="http://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a> is nice and I keep meaning to get into it a little bit more than I have. <a href="http://itunes.com">iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk">Amazon</a> cater to most mainstream buying tastes but from very much a mainstream angle. I&#8217;d love to see, or get involved in, something that combines some of the cool aspects of <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> et al with music. Time to come up with some ideas, or look around for interesting new sites me thinks.</p>
 <p>Oh and while I&#8217;m at it the new music I&#8217;m listening to at the moment includes:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.deepelm.com/bands/index_benton.html">Benton Falls</a> &#8211; Fighting Starlight</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.boysetsfire.org/">Boy Sets Fire</a> &#8211; Before the Eulogy</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.deepelm.com/bands/index_dead.html">Dead Red Sea</a> &#8211; Birds</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.startinglinerock.com/">The Starting Line</a> &#8211; Based on a True Story</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.theearlynovember.net/">The Early November</a> &#8211; The Room&#8217;s Too Cold</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.arcadefire.com/flash.html">The Arcade Fire</a> &#8211; Funeral</li>
  <li>Various (<a href="http://www.deepelm.com">Deep Elm</a>) &#8211; The Hope I Find Inside</li>
</ul>
 <p>Sorry, the about the last bit. It&#8217;s quite cathartic listing my musical leanings on here. Not sure why but I&#8217;m in good company as already noted. What music, or music web tools, do you swear by? Please note that I reserve the right to edit posts which seem to advocate music I dont like. You probably know who you are.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jan 2006</span>

    <p>More of a statement of intend, for posterity&#8217;s sake hopefully. Something I can look back on and think &#8220;Oh, yeah, I meant to do that&#8221; later in the year. Also so I dont forget, or just decide I couldn&#8217;t be bothered. Why this all of a sudden? Well, it&#8217;s the start of the new year anyway, but in particular the first meetup of people from the <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">Newcastle New Media</a> list got me thinking. And in particular more than thinking, wanting to act on existing thoughts.</p>
 <p>So, without further ado, here is a brief list of thinks I&#8217;m going to do this year &#8211; fingers crossed, in no partricular order and missing several things that no one reading this will care about:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Get as much out of the <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Future of Web Apps Summit</a> as possible. I&#8217;m pretty interested in the <em>design</em> of applications at the moment.</li>
  <li>Not still have a hangover for the <a href="http://clearleft.com">Clearleft</a> <a href="http://www.clearleft.com/services/training/ajax.php">Ajax training session</a> with <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy</a> two days after the summit.</li>
  <li>Get an article written and published in something I read.</li>
  <li>Package up the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/atmedia2006">feed syndicator</a> code base under a decent name and release it for anyone to use.</li>
  <li>Produce a real application using <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>.</li>
  <li>Somehow get to all four (or is it five, I can&#8217;t remember) of the <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006"><code>media&lt;/a&gt; themed nights out &amp;#8211; as well as as many of the workshops and presentations one personn can get to without &lt;a href="http://www.muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/01/5/</code>media2006.php&quot;&gt;cloning</a></li>
  <li>On the back of our first real local meetup get a few projects moving. Everyone put email addresses to faces, which I think was important, and should make getting together doing something active easier from now on.</li>
  <li>And finally something vague; (note that this isn&#8217;t me with an idea under wraps, this is as far as I&#8217;ve got!) Design and build something <em>of use</em> to the wider web community.</li>
</ul>
 <p>I may have forgetten a couple of things, I&#8217;ll add them as I see fit. Anyone else got a list that they would like to share? Either on here or post a link to your own site.</p>
