    <p>Last week we shipped <a href="https://www.gov.uk"><span class="caps">GOV</span>.UK</a>. Over the last year we&#8217;ve built a team to build a website. Now we&#8217;re busy building a culture too. I&#8217;ve got so much that needs writing up about everything we&#8217;ve been up to. Hopefully I&#8217;ll make a start in the next week or so.</p>

        Tale Of A Grok Pattern
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m all of a sudden adding lots more code to GitHub. Here&#8217;s the latest project, <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns">grok patterns for logstash</a>. At the moment this repo only contains one new pattern but I&#8217;m hoping to add more, and maybe even for others to add more too.</p>
<p>First, a bit of background. <a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> is the excellent, open source, log agregation and processing framework. It takes inputs from various configurable places, processes them with filters and then outputs the results. So maybe you&#8217;ll take inputs from various application log files and output then into an elastic search index for easy searching, or output the same inputs to graphite and statsd to get graphs of rates. One of the host powerful filters in logstash is the <a href="http://logstash.net/docs/1.0.17/filters/grok">grok filter</a>. It takes a grok pattern and parses out information contained in the text into fields that can be more easily used by outputs. This post serves hopefully as both an explanation of why and an example of how you might do that.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Rails logs are horrible, that is until you install the excellent <a href="https://github.com/roidrage/lograge">lograge</a> output formatter. That gives you lines like:</p>
<pre>GET /jobs/833552.json format=json action=jobs#show status=200 duration=58.33 view=40.43 db=15.26</pre>
<p>This contains loads of useful information that&#8217;s easily parsable by a developer. We have the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> status code, the rails controller and information about response time too. A grok filter lets us teach logstash about that information too. The working grok filter for filtering this line looks like this:</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<pre>LOGRAGE %{WORD:method}%{SPACE}%{DATA}%{SPACE}action=%{WORD:controller}#%{WORD:action}%{SPACE}status=%{INT:status}%{SPACE}duration=%{NUMBER:duration}%{SPACE}view=%{NUMBER:view}(%{SPACE}db=%{NUMBER:db})?%{GREEDYDATA}</pre>
<p>That was worked out pretty much with a bit of trial and error and use of the logstash java binary, using stdin and stdout inputs and outputs. It works but getting their wasn&#8217;t that much funand proving it works outside a running logstash setup was tricky. Enter rspec and the grok implementation in pure Ruby. The project above contains an Rspec matcher for use when testing grok filters for logstash. I&#8217;ll probably extract that into a gem at some point but you&#8217;ll get the idea. Now we can write tests like these:</p>
<pre>the lograge grok pattern
  with a standard lograge log line
    should have the correct http method value
    should have the correct value for the request duration
    should have the correct value for the request view time
    should have the correct controller and action
    should have the correct value for db time
  without the db time
    should have the correct value for the request view time
  with a post request
    should have the correct http method value

</pre>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns/blob/master/spec/lograge_spec.rb">tests themselves</a> are just basic Rspec with most of the work done in the <a href="https://github.com/garethr/logstash-patterns/blob/master/spec/spec_helper.rb">custom matcher</a>. This not only means I can be a bit more confident that my grok pattern works, it also provides a much nicer framework for writing more patterns for other log formats. Parsing rules like this are one area where test driven development is a huge boon in my experience. And with tests comes continuous integration, in this case via <a href="http://travis-ci.org/#!/garethr/logstash-patterns">Travis</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully find myself writing more patterns and tests for them, and if anyone wants to send pull requests and to start collecting working grok patterns together so much the better.</p>

        Riemann Puppet Module
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2012</span>

    <p>Thanks to an <a href="https://twitter.com/bitprophet/status/233626675307479040">errant tweet</a> I started playing with <a href="http://aphyr.github.com/riemann/">Riemann</a> again. It ticks lots of boxes for me, from the clojure to configuration as code and the overloadable dashboard application. What started as using Puppet and Vagrant to investigate Riemann turned into a full blown tool and module writing exercise, resulting in two related projects on GitHub.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-riemann/">garethr-riemann</a> is a Puppet module for installing and configuring Riemann. It allows for easily specifying your own server configuration and dashboard views.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/garethr/riemann-vagrant">riemann-vagrant</a> is a Vagrantfile and other code which uses above puppet module to setup a local testing environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>I like this combination, a separate Puppet module along with a vagrant powered test bed. I&#8217;ve written a reasonable rspec based test suite to check the module but it&#8217;s always easier to be able to run <em>vagrant provision</em> as well to check everything is working. This also turned out to be the perfect opportunity to use <a href="https://github.com/rodjek/librarian-puppet">Librarian-Puppet</a> to manage the dependencies and eventually to ship the module to the <a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/riemann">Puppet Forge</a>.</p>

        The Vagrantbox.es Story
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>A few weeks ago now <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> (a website I maintain for third party hosted <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> base boxes) dissapeared from the internet for a few days. This was completely my fault, the (lovely) hosting people <a href="https://www.ep.io/">ep.io</a> had unfortunately closed down the service they had in beta and I&#8217;d been so busy that I hadn&#8217;t had chance to move it elsewhere.</p>
<p>The original version of the site (I had the code and good backups of the data) was a pretty simple Django application, but I&#8217;d used it to experiment (read over-engineer) with various bits of tech including Varnish, Solr, some <span class="caps">ORM</span> caching and lots more. This had been great, but it made it less portable. I had everything described in Puppet, but with virtually no spare time I decided to go a different route.</p>
<p>I threw a flat version of the site up on <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>, served it using Nginx on <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and added a quick <em>Fork me on GitHub</em> badge to the top. Suggest a box moved from being a web form to a pull request. It&#8217;s fair to say I did this pretty quickly and made a good few typos on the way. But within a couple of weeks I&#8217;ve had 8 pull requests either fixing my bugs, removing dead boxes and adding new ones.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m going to take from this is, if you&#8217;re building a community project that&#8217;s aimed at developers, then throw the content on GitHub. In my case I have the entire site on there too but I think that&#8217;s secondary. Pull requests are much better than any content management system or workflow you&#8217;re likely to build, and even more importantly the time to implement something drops hugely.</p>
<p>With all the spare time I don&#8217;t have I&#8217;ll be thinking about a content management model using GitHub for content, pull requests for workflow and post commit hooks for loading that content into a site or service somewhere.</p>

        Static Sites With Nginx On Heroku
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Jun 2012</span>

    <p>I have a few static sites on Heroku but in one case in particular I already had quite an involved nginx configuration &#8211; mainly 410s for some previous content and a series of redirects from older versions of the site. The common way of having static sites on Heroku appears to be to use a simple Rack middleware, but that would have meant reimplementing lots of boring redirect logic.</p>
<p>Heroku <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks">buildpacks</a> are great. The newer cedar stack is no longer tied to a particular language or framework, instead all of the discovery and knowledge about particular software is put into a buildpack. As well as the Heroku provided list it&#8217;s possible to write you&#8217;re own. Or in this case use one someone has <a href="https://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx">created earlier</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just moved <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es/">Vagrantbox.es</a> over to Heroku due to the closure of a previous service. In doing that, instead of the simple database backed app, I&#8217;ve simply thrown all the content onto <a href="https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku">GitHub</a>. This means anyone can fork the content and send pull requests. Hopefully this should mean I pay a bit more attention to suggestions and new boxes.</p>
<p>The repository is a nice simple example of using the mentioned Heroku Nginx buildpack too. You just run the following command to create a new Heroku application.</p>
<pre>heroku create --stack cedar --buildpack http://github.com/essh/heroku-buildpack-nginx.git</pre>
<p>And then in typical Heroku fashion use a git remote to deploy changes and updates. The repository is split into a <em>www</em> folder with the site content and a <em>conf</em> folder with the nginx configuration. The only clever parts involve the use of an <span class="caps">ERB</span> template for the nginx configuration file so we can pickup the correct port. We also use 1 worker process and don&#8217;t automatically daemonize the process &#8211; Heroku deals with this itself.</p>
