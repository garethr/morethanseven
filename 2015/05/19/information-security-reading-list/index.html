  <h1 class="post-title">Information Security Reading List</h1>
  <span class="post-date">19 May 2015</span>
  <p>I read quite a bit (probably a book a week or so) and one of the topics
I&#39;ve been reading on for a while is information security. In a recent
conversation someone asked for some book suggestions, so I thought I&#39;d
write that up in a blog post rather than an email.</p>

<p>Most of this list isn&#39;t particularly technical. It&#39;s not a developers
list of software engineering tomes. If you&#39;re a developer or operator
then I&#39;d recommend reading some of the more policy or journalistic
pieces as well for context. And if you&#39;re just interested in the topic
but nor particularly technical I&#39;d skip the security engineering
suggestions.</p>

<p>Note that I make no claims about this being a particularly balanced
list, it&#39;s biased towards what I find interesting to read. Hopefully
you&#39;ll find it interesting too.</p>

<h2>Journalism</h2>

<p>Understanding why Information Security is important tends to require
some context. The following books provide that, with detailed real-world
stories of criminal and government activities.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dark-Net-Jamie-Bartlett/dp/0434023159">The Dark Net</a> - Jamie Bartlett - an excellent personal tale of
investigating the hidden side of the internet.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0">Spam Nation</a> - Brian Krebs - everything you wanted to know about how
and why Spam works.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/077043617X">Countdown to Zero Day</a> - Kim Zetter - a detailed and fast paced
description of the Stuxnet attack, and it&#39;s implications.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Crimes-Everything-Connected-Vulnerable/dp/0385539002">Future Crimes</a> - Marc Goodman - a focus on the criminal
possibilities of the modern internet and the internet of things.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Worm-The-First-Digital-World/dp/1611855845">Worm</a> - Mark Bowden - similar to the excellent tale of Stuxnet
above, this is the story of Conficker and how it was discovered</li>
</ul>

<h1>Policy and context</h1>

<p>These books are focused more on government policy and nation state
threats, and the debate about the rules of war and the internet.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Threat-National-Security/dp/0061962244">Cyber War</a> - Richard Clarke - probably the best description of what
cyber war is and isn&#39;t, and some of the geopolitical problems
emerging.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Will-Take-Place/dp/1849042802">Cyber War Will Not Take Place</a> - Thomas Rid - a good counter to the
above book, with lots more detailed discussion of policy and definition.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Cyber-Warfare-Mapping-Underworld/dp/1449310044">Inside Cyber Warfare</a> - Jeffrey Carr - really just a run through of
current threats, especially organised crime.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Security engineering</h1>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Erja14/book.html">Security Engineering</a> - Ross Anderson - highly technical and quite
epic, but definitely the best security engineering book around.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Threat-Modeling-Designing-Adam-Shostack/dp/1118809998">Threat Modelling</a> - Adam Shostack - details descriptions of how and
why to conduct threat moddelling, with lots of examples.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Driven-Security-Visualization-Dashboards/dp/1118793722">Data Driven Security</a> - Jay Jacobs and Bob Rudis - nice examples,
including code samples, of applying data and statistics tools and
practices to security problems.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloud-Security-Privacy-Enterprise-Perspective/dp/0596802765">Cloud Security and Privacy</a> - Tim Mather, Subra Kumaraswamy, Shahed
Latif - a good book to read for anyone working in AWS, Azure or similar.
Good discussion of concerns and compliance approaches in third party
environments.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Tangled-Web-Securing-Applications/dp/1593273886">The Tangled Web</a> - Michal Zalewski - everything you ever wanted to
know about the browser security model</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silence-Wire-Passive-Reconnaissance-Indirect/dp/1593270461">Silence on the Wire</a> - Michal Zalewski - described as a field guide
to passive reconnaissance and indirect attacks. Good for starting to
think about non-obvious security threats</li>
</ul>

<h1>On my reading list</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve not read these books yet so can&#39;t recommend them as such, but they
both look good additions to the list above.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Goliath-Bruce-Schneier/dp/0393244814">Data and Goliath</a> - Bruce Schneier - a look at the large scale data
collection programmes of governments and their implications for
everyone.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Code-Ronald-J-Deibert/dp/0771025351">Black Code</a> - Ronald J. Deibert - the story of the Citizen Lab
and it&#39;s front line cyber researchers</li>
</ul>
