    <p>Not sure how I missed this but apparently App Engine (as of 1.1.9) supports <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/remote_api.html">remote access to your live data store</a>. This means you can create administration applications more easily by running them locally, rather than within the limitations of the live platform. You can even run a local python prompt with access to your live datastore which is pretty neat.</p>

    <p><a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">RewiredState</a> was awesome. 100 or so geeks plus a smattering of government types gathered in the shiny new Guardian offices in Kings Cross on Saturday to hack (the Government).</p>
<p>Some events like this are more productive than others, and the end of day demos included some realy impressive stuff. See for your self on the <a href="http://projects.rewiredstate.org/">projects page</a></p>
<p>My own little project even won a prize (an invisible bottle of Champagne no less). My complain was that if you want to report an issue about the over 7000 government websites you have to do it per site. All of the sites do their own thing, which might be a nice contact form, maybe an email address or in some cases a postal address hidden on a page that&#8217;s not linked to from anywhere.</p>
<p>My solution was pretty simple &#8211; a centralised issue reporting and navigating tool. So you go along to the site you have an issue with and hit a bookmarklet (or a badge on the site if the site in question have been nice enough to add one). You fill in a very simple form which appears before your eyes and everything is tracked on a nice shiny website.</p>
<p>The advantage of all that is transparency. You can see which sites people have issue with, and also ideally which issues get addresses or at least acknowledged by the support staff for the site in question. The hack had comments so others could follow up on individual issues. It would be simple enough to have league tables and the like as well, or add tagging for a little bit of categorisation &#8211; I did only have a few hours though.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRi7Fww" alt="screenshot of FeedbackGov website"/></p>
<p>After a few nice comments I&#8217;m going to have to finish it off and get it up somewhere I think. All I really need to do is clean up the bookmarklet code (which was a hack in more ways than one) and add a bit of sanity checking to data entered into the system.</p>
<p>A massive well done to everyone involved is in order as well, especially <a href="http://coupde.com/">James</a> who I remember talking to the idea about ages ago. Congratulations all &#8211; and hopefully be back next year.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.phpied.com/">Stoyan Stefanov</a> just released an excellent little <a href="http://www.phpied.com/content-to-markup-ratio-bookmarklet/">bookmarklet to calculate a content to markup ratio</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting browsing around a few sites and comparing ratios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>This site &#8211; 0.55</li>
	<li><a href="http://bbc.co.uk">bbc.co.uk</a> &#8211; 0.26</li>
	<li><a href="http://capitalradio.co.uk">capitalradio.co.uk</a> &#8211; 0.45</li>

    <p>I gave a short presentation about App Engine last night at the <a href="http://campug.org.uk/">Cambridge Python User Group</a> and as always it&#8217;s available on <a href="http://slideshare.net">Slideshare</a>.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=appengine-090304031400-phpapp02&stripped_title=app-engine-for-python-developers" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>I find App Engine a great way of just writing (Python) code and putting it online quickly, and the presentation was aimed at being something of a fanboy ode. During questions afterwards we talked about some of the limitations and cases where App Engine isn&#8217;t as well suited, and at least a few people were heading off planning on having a play.</p>
<p>The event was good fun and I picked up a few Python related tips and tricks from the other presentations and general conversation. Thanks for everyone who organised and attended the event and to <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/">RealVNC</a> for hosting the talks.</p>

        Quick dmigrations Update

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2009</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve finally been getting round to doing a bit of work on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/">dmigrations</a>, the Python based database migration tool we developed at <a href="http://thisisglobal.com">work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>dmigrations offers a simple but flexible way of managing changes to the database in your Django projects. It is a replacement for Django&#8217;s built in syncdb command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still have some work to do to merge in a number of modifications we&#8217;ve been running internally for a while but I&#8217;ve triaged the issues list that had been left alone for too long and merged in a fantastic collection of patches from a few people including Alexander Robbins and <a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/">Chris Lamb</a>. Thanks hugely to everyone for these.</p>
<p>Everything is available in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/source/browse/#svn/trunk">trunk in <span class="caps">SVN</span></a> at the moment ahead of me cleaning a few thinks up and updating the download version. I&#8217;ve added a setup.py file as well ahead of hopefully adding it to the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi">Python Package Index</a>.</p>
<p>I obviously wasn&#8217;t the only one who had decided to do some work on the project in the last couple of days. <a href="http://www.djangosnippets.org/users/msaelices/">msaelices</a> has just submitted <a href="http://code.google.com/p/dmigrations/issues/detail?id=21">a patch</a> which adds a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> backend. I don&#8217;t tend to use PostgreSQL personally so if anyone does want to have a look at running dmigrations with the patch I&#8217;d love to hear about it.</p>
