    <span class="post-date">11 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>After my previous post about <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/why-the-webstandards-world-appears-to-be-choosing-django/">Django and the web standards community</a> a number of the comments picked up on the fact I mentioned <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">haml</a> under the title <em>Other Craziness</em>. Ok, so I was being a little over-poetic but I decided this warranted a closer look.</p>
<p>Haml is a markup language that&#8217;s used to cleanly and simply describe the <span class="caps">XHTML</span> of any web document without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a replacement for inline page templating systems such as <span class="caps">PHP</span>, <span class="caps">ASP</span>, and <span class="caps">ERB</span>, the templating language used in most Ruby on Rails applications.</p>
<p>A quick example should help. The following haml code&#8230;</p>
<pre><code>%div.special#primary Hello, World!</code></pre>
<p>&#8230;is compiled to the following <span class="caps">HTML</span>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class="special" id="primary"&gt;
  Hello, World!
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Depending on your application this could be at runtime or as part of a build step. Although primarily associated with Rails because haml is also available as a command line utility you could in theory use it with any framework or language.</p>
<p>My initial take on this was to call haml an abstraction of <span class="caps">HTML</span> but <a href="http://nex-3.com/">Nathan Weizenbaum</a>, one of haml&#8217;s developers, put me straight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haml doesn&#8217;t really abstract <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Not in the same sense that, say, Rails helpers do. Since Haml has a one-to-one mapping to <span class="caps">HTML</span>, I view it more as an alternate syntax for <span class="caps">HTML</span> than an abstraction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lots more examples for anyone interested can be found on <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/docs/">the haml documentation site</a>.</p>
<p>After some research and some playing around with the command line version of the haml engine I decided to see what Twitter thought about the situation. Little did I realise what I was letting myself in for:</p>
<p><a href="http://tommorris.org/">Tom Morris</a> kicked things off:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/tommorris/statuses/784959480">
<p>I&#8217;m not sure why everyone insists on clumsily reinventing <span class="caps">HTML</span> every few weeks (eg. wiki syntaxes, of which there are hundreds)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad Wright</a> thought:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/intranation/statuses/784963589">
<p>Sass is just stupid, since you&#8217;re basically writing <strong>exactly</strong> the same <span class="caps">CSS</span> just in shitty <span class="caps">YAML</span> style.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And followed with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&#8217;s the point of abstracting <span class="caps">HTML</span>? It&#8217;s not that hard</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Mark Norman Francis</a> chipped in with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">EVIL</span>. And not in a good, kittenish way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few people echoed <a href="http://thecssdiv.co.uk/">Ross Bruniges</a> sentiment that haml and sass are just:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/rossbruniges/statuses/784954916">
<p>front-end code for those who don&#8217;t really care all that much about it and would rather create databases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to admit to this being my initial reaction on hearing about and looking at haml, hence the remark from the previous post. But that&#8217;s not to say everyone was negative.</p>
<p><a href="http://donotremove.co.uk/">Mike Stenhouse</a> stepped in and said:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/mikesten/statuses/784952890">
<p>Love haml &#8211; it&#8217;s all I use these days. More readable, dynamic and hackable. Took me a while to come around to it though&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the comments were about how the use of haml might alter the dynamic of a team, to either positive or negative effect &#8211; depending on your point of view.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.markng.co.uk/">Mark Ng</a> saw it as a cunning way of getting rid of the front-end guy.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/markng/statuses/784952935">
<p>at first, they look elegant. Then it becomes obvious how they remove designers from the process of making markup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where as <a href="http://thinkdrastic.net/">Olly Hodgson</a> say it maybe as a route to get the dyed in the wool back-end writing decent markup.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/OllyHodgson/statuses/784957324">
<p>They look interesting. With proper training it might be a good way to get back-end programmers creating decent <span class="caps">HTML</span> (shock horror!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At present haml is very much pitched at the Rails community from whence it came. Many of the examples demonstrate benefits compared to <span class="caps">ERB</span>, and haml is of course written in Ruby and available as a Rails plugin. Being perceived as part of that community has obvious benefits but also some subtle costs, in particular regarding those people that don&#8217;t like Rails very much.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really convinced of the benefits in all fairness. The <em>something else to learn</em> barrier only gets magnified when working within a team environment. You now have to train new recruits of whatever skill level in another syntax. One that they might be able to write quickly enough but can they understand from the briefest of glances at a template? <span class="caps">HTML</span> might not be great here but it is familiar to everyone. Their is also the programmers abstraction. What if I can&#8217;t get the markup I want out the other side of the black box? Yes it&#8217;s open source so I can hack the box open but that causes even more problems. And while I quite like meaningful whitespace (for instance in Python), in templates which fail if it&#8217;s not quite right I see a major problem for those whom a text editor is not their best friend.</p>
<p>I am however interested to see whether the problems people have with haml are with haml in particular or with the overall approach of alternative syntax&#8217;s for <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>. Are DSLs (Domain Specific Languages) needed for <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span>? and if so is this a possible avenue for innovation on top of slow moving standards?</p>

        Git, Ditz and Microformats
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>I finally got round to making use of <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, the distributed source code management tools much loved by Open Source projects like the Linux Kernel and now Ruby on Rails. It had been on the long list of things to have a look at for quite a while but for the majority of my personal projects <span class="caps">SVN</span> is just fine. The reason that led me to finally run <em>sudo port install git-core</em> was the new <a href="http://ditz.rubyforge.org/">Ditz</a> command line issue tracking software release on <a href="http://gitorious.org/projects/ditz">Gitorious</a> by <a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/people/wmorgan/">William Morgan</a>.</p>
<p>Now, a command line issue tracker is maybe kind of niche and a little geeky. But most desktop or web based issue trackers just seem to wind me up and I like small tools that fit in with my command line centric workflow. I managed to clone <a href="http://gitorious.org/projects/ditz/repos/ditz-microformats">my own copy</a> of Ditz to have a play with. I ran into a few initial problems but nothing a <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/tutorial.html">good tutorial</a> and a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gitorious">helpful mailing list</a> couldn&#8217;t fix.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not just playing around either; Ditz comes with the nice ability to generate a set of static <span class="caps">HTML</span> files representing your issue database. I&#8217;ve committed and pushed a few modifications and enhancements onto my clone &#8211; mainly validation, semantic markup improvements and a smattering of microformats (work in progress) in the templates and a couple of markup generation helpers in the Ruby code. I plan on working up the interface a little as well but like any good web designer I&#8217;m starting with the underlying markup structure.</p>
<p>A few other enhancements I&#8217;d love to see in Ditz or a clone I could pull from include the ability to use  <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> rather than the default <span class="caps">YAML</span> for larger projects, automatic generation of <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds alongside the <span class="caps">HTML</span> (although I&#8217;ve started implementing hAtom) and maybe automated deployment to a remote host over <span class="caps">FTP</span> or <span class="caps">SSH</span>.</p>
<p>The distributed nature of Git appears to be pushed as the main advantage to those developers taking a look. But I think this is, in many cases, is not <em>that</em> important compared to the familiarity that comes from having used <span class="caps">SVN</span> or similar for a while. What I think just might be it&#8217;s real strength is that Git is a <strong>social source control system</strong>. For Open Source projects like Ditz this is a potentially game changing move. The ease with which anyone can contribute and take things in strange directions without affecting the overall effort is fantastic. It removes barriers to entry for contributors and means making small quick changes is much easier and more immediate. With both Gitorious and <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> wrapping Git in a shiny web based interface that focuses on these social aspects it will be interesting to see if this leads to more or faster Open Source collaboration efforts.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m just back from another great few days in Scotland for <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">The Highland Fling</a>. The biggest difference for me this year was I was lucky enough to be one of the speakers. Amongst such internet luminaries as <a href="http://simonwillison.co.uk/">Simon Willison</a>, <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">Norm</a>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/author/974138">Chris Mills</a>, <a href="http://wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilman</a>, <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral Balkan</a> and <a href="http://boagworld.com/">Paul Boag</a> I presented on a few web building blogs (<span class="caps">HTTP</span>, URLs) and on some suggestions for <span class="caps">API</span> design. The presentation is available on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/a-first-class-web-citizen/">slideshare</a> for anyone who would like a peek.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=webcitizen-1207330793788509-9"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slideshare.net/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=webcitizen-1207330793788509-9" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>I think the topic went down well and it triggered some good discussion around the nascent issue of <span class="caps">API</span> design. One thing is clear &#8211; we need some good resources filled with examples on the subject. More and more people are going to be extending various bits of software with an <span class="caps">API</span> and it would be nice to think they will all be a pleasure to use. In the meantime is you have any features or guidelines your like to see in APIs then suggest them <a href="http://doesyourapi.com/suggest/">over here</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the conference was great. I particularly enjoyed Norms little history lesson and Aral has me at least thinking about installing all the Flash and Flex tool chain. The highlight for me was probably the format. After each presentation we got a little grilling by Paul. He came up with a few thorny questions for each of us as well as fielding questions from the audience. Hopefully my stint on the sofa made sense to a few people, certainly everyone else threw out a few interesting titbits that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been talked about otherwise. Also, Chris Mills nearly managed to make Paul cry with laughter by striking something of a rock star pose for most of his interview.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just uploaded a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethr/sets/72157604386886719/">handful of photos</a> from the event and surrounding geek gatherings too. All in all the event was great (again). With the close venue, interviews mixed in and general friendly atmosphere The Highland Fling had an intimate feel often missing from events. Huge credit goes to <a href="http://www.azcazandco.com/">Alan</a> and hopefully we&#8217;ll all be back next year.</p>

    <p>Quick post to say BarCampNorthEast tickets are now available. We&#8217;re starting off releasing 50 tickets and we&#8217;ll see how that goes. We&#8217;re really not sure how quickly these will disappear so get them while they&#8217;re hot. More tickets will be available later as well.</p>

<p>The event is looking like its going to be great. I&#8217;m really happy we managed to find a venue that would let us do the whole sleeping over thing.

        Why the webstandards world appears to be choosing Django
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Mar 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been noticing an interesting trend recently, not one I have any empirical evidence for mind, but one I though interesting non-the-less. Parts of the webstandards world appear to all be playing with <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a>. Part of this has been the odd mention down the pub, at barcamps or at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> this year. But the main source of information on the topic has been <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. To name but a few I&#8217;ve seen tweets from <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a>, <a href="http://thecssdiv.co.uk">Ross</a> and <a href="http://aralbalkan.com">Aral</a> recently and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart</a> and <a href="http://cyril.doussin.name/thoughts/">Cyril</a> literally wont shut up about it.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that this didn&#8217;t happen with Rails, not in the corner of the pub that generally talks more about markup, javascript and <span class="caps">CSS</span> anyway. I&#8217;ve worked on a couple of Rails projects both personally and commercially, and I&#8217;ve just launched a little pet project build with django called <a href="http://doesyourapi.com">doesyourapi</a>. What follows is, to my mind, a few reasons why I think this trend exists and also why I think it will continue, at least for the time being.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>You can&#8217;t ignore the personal touch, and in <a href="http://simonwillison.com">Simon Willison</a> and <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/">Stuart Langridge</a> we already have two people who bridge the Python/Django community and the web standards crowd, at least in the UK. Personal technology choices at least are often driven by personal correspondence.</p>
<h3>Templating</h3>
<p>Django&#8217;s templating introduces a very simple syntax <em>and nothing else</em>. Rails lets you have the full power of Ruby to do with as you will within your views. Rails also makes heavy use of helpers, further adding to the complexity of views. Now I have mixed views here, based on my own skills more than anything. I know I&#8217;d feel much more comfortable throwing someone with good markup skills at a project using Django than Rails. For the most part with Django you use the html you&#8217;re used to, Rails often wants you to change this to helpers &#8211; in much the same way as <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> does in fact. I think some of this comes from the Rails <em>don&#8217;t repeat yourself</em> <del>philosophy</del> <ins>obsession</ins>. Sometimes this leads to programmatic complexity which makes working with templates more akin to programming, even if it means less duplication. I&#8217;ve yet to work on a particularly complex Django project so maybe this simplicity might become a limitation to work around? Always a possibility.</p>
<h3>Default craziness</h3>
<p>Some of the bits and pieces that come bundled with Rails are just plain wrong, the Javascript helpers being one example. The abuse of <span class="caps">HTTP</span> by default in some of the scaffolding code being another. Oh, and the markup coming out of various helpers as well. In trying to help the application developer Rails gets in the way of the professional webstandards types. Django does next to none of this for you. Programmers coming from Rails might see this as missing features. Frontend types prefer this clean slate approach because it means you don&#8217;t have to fight the backend (sometimes including people) for control of the output. Note that you can work around much of this (in the same way as you can work <em>around</em> <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> if you have to), it&#8217;s just nicer to not have to.</p>
<h3>Other craziness</h3>
<p>Rails people love Ruby. After all it&#8217;s better than Java (it&#8217;s also a pretty loveable programming language too). But like computer science departments everywhere many Rails people also dislike or simply put up with <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and Javascript. If they can find a way of not having to write these and write something else (Rails people are also obsessed with domain specific languages) instead. Hence we have the likes of <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/"><span class="caps">HAML</span></a> and <a href="http://lab.hamptoncatlin.com/play/with/sass"><span class="caps">SASS</span></a>. The problem is that us frontend loving folk quite like writing <span class="caps">CSS</span> (well, sometimes) and absolutely love writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>. Most of the time for good reasons too &#8211; just look at microformats for an example. Frontend developers tend to like using a mix of tools, predominantly backend developers not so much it seems.</p>
<p>Personally I find it interesting. You could quite easily flip many of these arguments around to support why so many people are using Rails. For two frameworks with similar goals and uses it&#8217;s interesting to see the early philosophical differences playing out in the real world. It might be interesting to see what happens with frameworks like <a href="http://merbivore.com/">Merb</a> as well which seems to be set out to avoid many of these perceived issues with Rails. So, have anyone else noticed anything similar? Or even the complete opposite?</p>
