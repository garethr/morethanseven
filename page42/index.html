    <p>The North East is stealing a march on London this week with all sorts going on for those who like a real world get together. Although not quite as busy as <a href="http://www.londonwebweek.co.uk/">London Web Week</a> next week we have the <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> conference kicking off tomorrow, followed by a <a href="geekdinner.co.uk/">Geek Dinner</a> on Friday night and then <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">BarCampNorthEast</a> over the weekend. I&#8217;m even planning on popping out tonight with a few people in town for the festivities. As if fate somehow got involved the weather is also pretty darn nice today too.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already know about these events and you&#8217;re in the area their just might still be the chance to come along. We have a few places left for barcamp in particular, you just need to <a href="http://barcampnortheast.eventwax.com/barcampnortheast/register">register over on eventwax</a>. And the Geek Dinner on friday night at The Pitcher and Piano is open to all, at least until it fills up.</p>
<p>It really is great to see thing happening at this end of the country, and a real shame I&#8217;m leaving the area so soon afterwards. I really hope the local community gets behind all these events and they act as a catalyst for interesting things. I&#8217;ve always been of the mind that if you can get enough smart, interested people together in one place then good things will happen. It&#8217;s why I enjoy going along to conferences, hackdays and barcamps. It&#8217;s also one of the main reasons I joined GCap.</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;ve recovered from the next two weeks (which may take a while as next week I&#8217;m in London for <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/">@media</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon4">BarCampLondon4</a> and anything else I can get along to) I&#8217;ll hopefully write more about trying to organise a barcamp and, if I really get time to think, about knowledge workers outside and inside London.</p>
<p>But in the meantime leave a comment if you&#8217;re going to be around in Newcastle over the next week. It should be a great opportunity to meet new and old friends alike.</p>

    <p>I just finished my presentation on the last day of the Xtech conference in Dublin. I&#8217;d chosen to ramble on about the advantages, problems and a few solutions of building applications atop of lots of APIs. The presentation is now up on <a href="http://slideshare.net">slideshare</a> at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/">slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting conversations have been occurring all week and a few people have mentioned a near barcamp feel at times. It&#8217;s a pretty small, clued-up, technical audience and as always some of the best bits have been conversations in the corridors.<br />
<a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> has been <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/tag/xtech08">live blogging many of the talks</a> which should be a worth a read later on. Although with three tracks most of the time that&#8217;s only some of the great talks on offer.</p>

    <p>On departing <a href="http://www.pubstandards.co.uk/">pubstandards</a> in London a few weeks ago <a href="http://blog.ginader.de/">Dirk Ginader</a> said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Dopplr you&#8217;ve spent 40 odd days in London in the last 8 months. Don&#8217;t you think you might as well just move here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that had anything to do with it, but I&#8217;m happy to announce I&#8217;m moving to London in a permanent manner very very soon. I&#8217;m taking up a job at <a href="http://www.gcapmedia.com"><span class="caps">GCAP</span></a>, working with quite a few people I know from various web goings on; Hi to <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a>, <a href="http://thecssdiv.co.uk/">Ross</a>, <a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad</a>, <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/">Ed</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart</a> amongst others.</p>
<p>Freelancing for the last year has been great. I&#8217;d been able to work on the variety of projects I&#8217;d wanted after leaving my previous job, and I&#8217;ve had more time to myself when I wanted to get involved with other projects. <a href="http://webstandards.org">WaSP</a>, <a href="http://sxsw.com/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a>, <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/">Highland Fling</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">BarCamp</a>, <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> to name a few things I&#8217;ve been up to in the past 6 months. But something about working with a super smart team of people won me over. The fact that I&#8217;ll get to focus on Python and Django is an added bonus.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmldog.com/">Patrick</a> apparently closed the book on this happening some time ago. I&#8217;m just hoping someone got the date about right and won the money. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll write more about the whole thing as time permits and lots of specific topics spring to mind. I have a number of events in the next month to get along to before all this happens however; if you&#8217;re along at Xtech, Thinking Digital, London Web Week, BarCamp NorthEast, BarCamp London 4 or @media then remember to say hi. My addiction to attending web events can only get worse with me being nearer London I fear.</p>

        A Really Simple Capistrano Recipe
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>Build scripts. I think I&#8217;ve probably mentioned before; everyone knows they should but not many actually do. I&#8217;m not talking about your large in-house development teams or your sexy web startups; both probably have a good-enough build process for different reasons. But smaller teams, web design agencies or freelancers often rely on <span class="caps">FTP</span> and a prayer. One of the problems is definitely finding <em>suitable</em> documentation. It&#8217;s not that their isn&#8217;t a lot of good quality documentation &#8211; it&#8217;s the suitability of it for those with only a passing interest and a limited systems administration experience.</p>
<p><a href="http://capify.org/">Capistrano</a> is a tool for automating tasks on remote servers. It can be used for all sorts of useful things but we&#8217;ll concentrate on it&#8217;s utility for web site deployment. It&#8217;s been popular with the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Rails</a> crowd for a while and is written in Ruby, but it can be used for deploying sites in Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Django, whatever you happen to be using at the time.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll first need to install Ruby and Capistrano. The Capistrano site has <a href="http://capify.org/install">installation instructions</a> which should get you up and running. You&#8217;ll need to be able to use a console on your machine and have a passing acquaintance with your webserver. I&#8217;ve also assumed that you&#8217;re using source control, mainly because if you&#8217;re not you should start their. Automation becomes much more useful and practical on the back of a good source control system.</p>
<p>Right, lets get started. Create a file called <em>capfile</em> somewhere on your local machine. The following two code snippets should go in that file.</p>
<pre><code>set :username, "&lt;username&gt;"
set :host, "&lt;host&gt;"
set :path, "&lt;path&gt;"
set :restart, "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart"
set :checkout, "svn export --force"
set :repo, "&lt;repository address&gt;"</code></pre>
<p>Just replace the variables (marked with angle brackets) with your own values. The path is the full path on the remote server where you want to deploy your files to. Note that I&#8217;ve abstracted out the webserver restart command and the source control checkout command. The above example values assume you&#8217;re using apache and subversion (and want to do a subversion export). It should be easy enough to change these for your preferred combination of source control system and webserver.</p>
<pre><code>desc "Remote checkout and restart of webserver"
task :deploy, :hosts =&gt; "#{username}@#{host}" do
  run "#{checkout} #{repo} #{path}; #{restart}"
end</code></pre>
<p>If your platform of choice doesn&#8217;t require a server restart (say <span class="caps">PHP</span>) you can always remove the <em>; #{restart}</em> portion of the command.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re all set up just bring up a console in the folder containing the <em>capfile</em> and run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>cap deploy</code></pre>
<p>After prompting for a password to access the remote machine this should display the output from the commands being run. Depending on the size of the repository you&#8217;re checking out</p>
<p>Of course for most projects you would want to expand this basic recipe. Maybe you have database updates to run or need to deploy to multiple machines at once? You&#8217;ll might have machine specific configuration files which aren&#8217;t in the source control system. You will also probably want to be able to revert back if something goes wrong and you might want to only change files that have been altered. Capistrano has lots of powerful features built in that will let you do just that, and once you get started with this sort of build scripting you&#8217;ll find lots of areas to improve. And you&#8217;ll find lots of good tutorials online that will take you further.</p>
<p>The difficult part with project automation and build scripts is often the <em>getting started</em> in the first place; especially if you&#8217;re not the server admin type. Unfortunately the documentation and articles written on the subject tend to be somewhat arcane and aimed at the more hardcore developer. Hopefully this simple, usable, example convinces someone else to give it a try.</p>

        Resourceful Vs Hackable Search URLs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>I often end up pondering <span class="caps">URL</span> design given a moment and something that keeps coming up is hackable search queries. But first a very quick primer on the idea of resourceful design.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> is a series of architectural principals more than a defined architecture. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_oriented_architecture">Resource Orientated Architecture</a> builds on those ideas with a series of concrete guidelines put down by <a href="http://intertwingly.net">Sam Ruby</a> for designing RESTful systems. The simple version is that you try to design your system around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_%28Web%29">resources</a> represented by URLs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d thoroughly recommend reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/RESTful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260">RESTful web services</a> whenever you get a moment as this subject is covered in detail.</p>
<p>Flickr isn&#8217;t a truly resourceful design but it does have many of the hallmarks. For example the <span class="caps">URL</span> that describes me is at:</p>
<pre><code>http://flickr.com/people/garethr</code></pre>
<p>When it comes to searching on flickr we have:</p>
<pre><code>http://flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=pubstandards&amp;m=text</code></pre>
<p>The pattern of using a query string argument named <em>q</em> to pass a search string is pretty common. One of the guidelines mentioned as part of the <span class="caps">ROA</span> discussed query strings:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Query string parameters are appropriate if they are inputs to a Resource which is an algorithm. Otherwise, these values should be moved into the <span class="caps">URI</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search is definitely algorithmic. Now you could maybe argue that a global search should be done on the root of a site, with specific resource searches on the resource in questions. eg. <em>/people/?q=</em>. This would likely work fine but require some behind the scenes complexity as well as probably not being as obvious to the end user. Global searches are in many cases much more common that restricted searches and even in resourceful designs the root of the site (ie. the home page) might not act as a list of available site resources. A notable exception might would have to be the excellent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes"><span class="caps">BBC</span> Programmes</a> site which is basically one big semantic catalogue.</p>
<p>But we have another kind of <span class="caps">URL</span> that&#8217;s cropping up for search results, one that treats the <span class="caps">URL</span> much more like a fundamental part of the user interface for search. An example from a site I use all the time is <a href="http://traintimes.org.uk/">The Accessible UK Train Timetable</a> which allows for URLs like the following:</p>
<pre><code>http://traintimes.org.uk/newcastle/london</code></pre>
<p>You can basically squash all the search parameters from the form into the <span class="caps">URL</span>, meaning you can easily bookmark search results. Note however the actual content is likely to change. The above example for instance would use the current time to get a list of trains from Newcastle to London. In an hours time the results will be different.</p>
<p>Another good example would be the new Yahoo! UK TV listings which has URLs like these:</p>
<pre><code>http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/listings/bbc-two/2008-04-17/</code></pre>

<pre><code>http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/listings/itv1/2008-04-17/21-00/</code></pre>
<p>Again this is really a search query, or at least specifying the time and date is. In some ways it&#8217;s the return of the command line &#8211; allowing searches to be run very quickly from a textual interface.</p>
<p>Now, both these approaches treat URLs with the respect they deserve. But they do have the potential to clash somewhere in the middle if care isn&#8217;t taken. The Accessible Train Times site is a single purpose site which just does searches while <span class="caps">BBC</span> Programmes does feature a search engine but it&#8217;s just the global <span class="caps">BBC</span> search which takes you off site. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough potential competition then a question raised by <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> at The Highland Fling regarding <span class="caps">URL</span> design and the search engine optimisation crowd go me thinking too. From being a somewhat niche area of interest URLs might just become a sort after part of a good website design &#8211; fought over by the varying disciplines of modern web design and development.</p>
