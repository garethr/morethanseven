        Where are the Rock Star Web Project Managers?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>In maybe a more constructive manner than <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/media-designers-vs-developers/">yesterday</a> I started wondering where the rock star web project managers hang out? I think we&#8217;re all aware of something of a celebrity culture within web circles. Their are a hardcore of people who&#8217;s blogs, books and conference appearances we&#8217;ve all seen several times over. And in the main I think this has had a positive effect on everyone involved. People like <a href="http://adaction.com">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a> have at different times acted as pretty useful barometers and yard sticks for lots of people. But these people are invariably designers and developers &#8211; not product managers or project managers.</p>
<p>The only person I can think of who has talked a little about the topic of project management is <a href="http://blog.geekmanager.co.uk/">Meri</a> with her new book <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/project1/">Principles of Project Management</a>. The topic occasionally comes up in conversation, or is mentioned by the designers and developers noted above. And their are lots of blogs (more often by developers it seems) about Agile, XP and Scrumm. But what about the practice of web product management? You can point to countless blogs written by designers and developers at the likes of last.fm, flickr and Yahoo. But where are the managers?</p>
<p>So, my question to you is: do you know of any great web product or project managers that blog about the discipline?</p>

        @media: Designers Vs Developers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Jun 2008</span>

    <p>Another successful <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2008/">@media</a> conference comes to a close and as usual interesting things were said and hopefully everyone learned something. As usual I have a few more things on my <em>must find time to play with</em> list. More on those if they happen.</p>
<p>But one part of the conference I felt needed addressing straight away was the first days panel. <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/sessions/#hottopics">The Hot Topics</a> panels bring together a few of the days speakers to answer questions posed by the audience. This year each day had it&#8217;s own panel discussion, with the first days session having a design theme. So far so good, and before I getting going I have to say I think <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/">Jeffrey Veen</a> did a sterling job of prodding and prompting the session along. The rest of the panel composed of <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Andy Clarke</a>, <a href="http://superfluousbanter.org/">Dan Rubin</a>, <a href="http://presentimperfect.com/">Bronwyn Jones</a> and <a href="http://www.indiyoung.com/">Indi Young</a>.</p>
<p>The panel fielded a few interesting questions (and The Beatles in-joke was highly entertaining) but the whole thing took an odd turn part way through &#8211; odd in the sense that everything suddenly became very anti-developer.</p>
<p>Andy Clarke seemed to be the ring leader here saying things like (I&#8217;m paraphrasing here) &#8220;I hate daily stand-ups, we should do Agile&#8221;. Dan Rubin was involved too, seemingly saying all developers prefer the rigid nine to five because they&#8217;re logical people, while designers want to be able to work whenever they choose. This and other comments caused a few good friends and web developers on the front row to literally shake their fists in anger. The audience got involved too, cheering the anti-developer or anti-engineer statements on. In my mind damage had just been done to <del>out</del> <ins>our</ins> industry.</p>
<p>Buidling web sites or applications is a pretty multidisciplinary exercise, and in any team environment good communication is often the difference between executing well and failing badly. Conferences like @media are a great place to come together with people from different disciplines and similar jobs in different organisations and share stories. I&#8217;m not saying either Dan or Andy haven&#8217;t had bad experiences with developers or stand-ups. I&#8217;m not saying bad individuals or bad process don&#8217;t exist (I have scars from both). I&#8217;m saying that generalising these experiences and then promoting them to impressionable designers is dangerous.</p>
<p>I have the good fortune of working with a great designer, <a href="http://csensedesign.co.uk/blog/">Alex Lee</a>, at GCap at the moment. He&#8217;s involved in our stand-up meetings every morning and without him there we would waste untold amounts of time and effort. If he turned up on monday and said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to come to stand-ups anymore, Andy Clarke says they aren&#8217;t cool&#8221;. We have a massive problem. My fear is this is exactly what&#8217;s going to happen somewhere tomorrow.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m something of a hybrid; I&#8217;ve run the whole gamut of design and development activities during my career to-date (I&#8217;ve even touched on project management) and have worked in small and medium sized agencies, as an independent freelancer and now in a decent sized in-house team. All of these roles pose different communication challenges which require different solutions. What works for three people in a distributed team doesn&#8217;t work for fifteen people working in-house. Some types and sizes of team work best with stand-ups, others work best being in the same small room together. Sometimes you need a centralised audit trail of everything that has happened on a project, other times it&#8217;s overkill. Somethings everyone has to be working on the project at the same time, at other times as long as tasks get done it really doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying I <em>like</em> all of those working conditions &#8211; I&#8217;m saying that if you understand where they work best you can work in the environment that suits you. Andy Clarke runs a <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/index.php/">boutique agency</a> doing high quality work, working with a very small team where individual flexibility and minimal process is definitely the best approach. I now work in a cross disciplinary team of maybe sixty people and it&#8217;s a different ball game completely.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t an attack on Andy, or Dan, or even an anti-designer rant. The web is a young industry filled with young people. We&#8217;re learning as we go and stealing what we can from other disciplines. Also not that many of us really like the idea of project management, never mind the reality. Agile methods like Scrumm are hot at the moment but that&#8217;s not to say we won&#8217;t find something that better suites our discipline in the future. Iterative development, while often annoying to designers, appears to be producing better results. If designers, and developers, want to change how we work together for the better, then get interested in project management and lets have a discussion in public. If you want to complain about individual experiences then that&#8217;s why you have a blog.</p>

    <span class="post-date">20 May 2008</span>

    <p>The North East is stealing a march on London this week with all sorts going on for those who like a real world get together. Although not quite as busy as <a href="http://www.londonwebweek.co.uk/">London Web Week</a> next week we have the <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> conference kicking off tomorrow, followed by a <a href="geekdinner.co.uk/">Geek Dinner</a> on Friday night and then <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">BarCampNorthEast</a> over the weekend. I&#8217;m even planning on popping out tonight with a few people in town for the festivities. As if fate somehow got involved the weather is also pretty darn nice today too.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already know about these events and you&#8217;re in the area their just might still be the chance to come along. We have a few places left for barcamp in particular, you just need to <a href="http://barcampnortheast.eventwax.com/barcampnortheast/register">register over on eventwax</a>. And the Geek Dinner on friday night at The Pitcher and Piano is open to all, at least until it fills up.</p>
<p>It really is great to see thing happening at this end of the country, and a real shame I&#8217;m leaving the area so soon afterwards. I really hope the local community gets behind all these events and they act as a catalyst for interesting things. I&#8217;ve always been of the mind that if you can get enough smart, interested people together in one place then good things will happen. It&#8217;s why I enjoy going along to conferences, hackdays and barcamps. It&#8217;s also one of the main reasons I joined GCap.</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;ve recovered from the next two weeks (which may take a while as next week I&#8217;m in London for <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/">@media</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon4">BarCampLondon4</a> and anything else I can get along to) I&#8217;ll hopefully write more about trying to organise a barcamp and, if I really get time to think, about knowledge workers outside and inside London.</p>
<p>But in the meantime leave a comment if you&#8217;re going to be around in Newcastle over the next week. It should be a great opportunity to meet new and old friends alike.</p>

    <p>I just finished my presentation on the last day of the Xtech conference in Dublin. I&#8217;d chosen to ramble on about the advantages, problems and a few solutions of building applications atop of lots of APIs. The presentation is now up on <a href="http://slideshare.net">slideshare</a> at <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/">slideshare.net/garethr/design-strategies-for-a-distributed-web/</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of interesting conversations have been occurring all week and a few people have mentioned a near barcamp feel at times. It&#8217;s a pretty small, clued-up, technical audience and as always some of the best bits have been conversations in the corridors.<br />
<a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a> has been <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/tag/xtech08">live blogging many of the talks</a> which should be a worth a read later on. Although with three tracks most of the time that&#8217;s only some of the great talks on offer.</p>

        Moving to London, Working For GCAP

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2008</span>

    <p>On departing <a href="http://www.pubstandards.co.uk/">pubstandards</a> in London a few weeks ago <a href="http://blog.ginader.de/">Dirk Ginader</a> said something along the lines of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Dopplr you&#8217;ve spent 40 odd days in London in the last 8 months. Don&#8217;t you think you might as well just move here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying that had anything to do with it, but I&#8217;m happy to announce I&#8217;m moving to London in a permanent manner very very soon. I&#8217;m taking up a job at <a href="http://www.gcapmedia.com"><span class="caps">GCAP</span></a>, working with quite a few people I know from various web goings on; Hi to <a href="http://simonwillison.net">Simon</a>, <a href="http://thecssdiv.co.uk/">Ross</a>, <a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad</a>, <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/">Ed</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">Stuart</a> amongst others.</p>
<p>Freelancing for the last year has been great. I&#8217;d been able to work on the variety of projects I&#8217;d wanted after leaving my previous job, and I&#8217;ve had more time to myself when I wanted to get involved with other projects. <a href="http://webstandards.org">WaSP</a>, <a href="http://sxsw.com/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a>, <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/">Highland Fling</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">BarCamp</a>, <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> to name a few things I&#8217;ve been up to in the past 6 months. But something about working with a super smart team of people won me over. The fact that I&#8217;ll get to focus on Python and Django is an added bonus.</p>
<p><a href="http://htmldog.com/">Patrick</a> apparently closed the book on this happening some time ago. I&#8217;m just hoping someone got the date about right and won the money. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll write more about the whole thing as time permits and lots of specific topics spring to mind. I have a number of events in the next month to get along to before all this happens however; if you&#8217;re along at Xtech, Thinking Digital, London Web Week, BarCamp NorthEast, BarCamp London 4 or @media then remember to say hi. My addiction to attending web events can only get worse with me being nearer London I fear.</p>
