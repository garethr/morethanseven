        Ruby on Rails on Nokia N800

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2007</span>

    <p>My latest job has allowed me to get back into playing with <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for a year or so. Having got everything up to date and installed on my virtual server and on my laptop I couldn&#8217;t resist seeing if I could get it going on my <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n800">N800</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are mainly that the idea of a wireless web server in my pocket is pretty intriguing. Think about it. If you&#8217;re at an event with Wi-Fi you can just point people to an IP address and hey presto they have access to your details, or a set of photos, or whatever you want to show them. I&#8217;ve also got nginx installed, but I&#8217;m not as yet that up on running python or <span class="caps">PHP</span> behind it on the N800. So, no need to carry around the laptop. OK, maybe it&#8217;s just me and all this going to web conferences? We&#8217;ll have to see if I actually knock up anything useful for the next conference and see. Saving that I&#8217;ve been travelling quite a bit recently and it&#8217;s handy when reading a Rails book to be able to try out the examples.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that you can indeed <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kwe/484269853/">install Ruby and Rails on the N800</a>, although their isn&#8217;t much information around and non of it worked exactly as stated for me &#8211; hence this post.</p>
<p>I followed along with a <a href="http://www.digitalknk.com/2007/05/27/howto-ruby-on-rails-on-your-nokia-n800/">pretty good tutorial</a>, although I already had Red Pill Mode, XTerm and <span class="caps">SSH</span> installed. Ruby is also now available in the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/ruby185/">Garage</a>.</p>
<p>The crux of the post is that you can find the required packages, in particular for Gem, <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/">here</a>. But unfortunately that is were the problems start. I ran into exactly the same problem as described in the comments in the above post, on <a href="http://railsgrunt.com/2007/5/14/installing-ruby-on-rails-on-the-n800">this blog post</a> and on this <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/">Internet Tablet Talk</a> <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5442&amp;page=2">forum thread</a>. Specifically, Gem hanging, crashing or returning a segmentation fault in the yaml.rb file on line 133.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be (this is me guessing here) with gem and the N800 being able download all the info for Gem to update it&#8217;s package list. The solution, or rather a suitable workaround, is to download the individual gems yourself to the local file system or a memory card and then install them from there. You can get all the Rails gems <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/gems/">here</a>. A quick script/server later and I had the familiar Rails welcome screen on port 3000. This should in theory work for oher gems as well. You can either download them directly or use Gem on a local machine and them move the files across via bluetooth or <span class="caps">USB</span>.</p>

    <p>Being busy is to be expected with this new start-up malarkey but whoa. The problem is I have even more ideas for real posts or articles (the type you research, play around with, then write properly) and, for the next few weeks, not the time to do them justice. I&#8217;ll be back with gusto when I find the time. In the interim here are a few things from the last month or so I consider <em>cool</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I has <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag</a>! Sorry, but I couldn&#8217;t resist after <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a>. Expect <span class="caps">API</span> hacking and silly photos on flickr aplenty.</li>
	<li>Oh, <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a> was an absolute blast. Thanks to Matt, Ian, Tom and the cast of hundreds.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m working on a cool Ruby on Rails app in the real world, up here in Newcastle no less.</li>
	<li><a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">@media</a> was, yet again, fab. A (very) late shout to Patrick and the umper lumpers. Can I make it to @media Ajax?</li>
	<li><a href="http://refreshnewcastle.org/">Refresh Newcastle</a> got a minor update with more flickr and upcoming goodness. Tag things <em>refreshnewcastle</em> for some lovin.</li>
	<li><a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">hedgehoglab.com</a> has a few more pages, a <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/training/survey">survey on web training needs</a> and more microformats than you can shake a stick at.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://dconstruct.org">dconstruct</a> (just). Another jigsaw piece of my increasingly bloody minded attempt to get to as many UK web get-togethers as possible.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ll be along to <a href="http://rubyandrails.org/usergroups/newcastle/">ncl.rb</a> tomorrow night (thursday) and in the pub afterwards if anyone is around. Their have been a few good events in Newcastle recently, only some of which I&#8217;ve managed to get along to. I&#8217;m considering getting an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">Open Coffee</a> do up and running in Newcastle as well. If anyone is interested let me know.</li>

        Target(ing) on CSS3
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Jun 2007</span>

    <p>Apologies up front for the bad pun but I&#8217;ve been busy playing with another little feature found in CSS3, namely the :target pseudo-class.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually pretty well described in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/#target-pseudo">CSS3 Selectors module</a>, (although given that the specs make lots of use of partial URLs the spec style sheet is crying out for use of said selector to I digress).</p>
<p>Put simply it allows you to style elements of a page that are the target of in page anchors, ie. <code>&amp;lt;a href="#target"&amp;gt;in page link&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;</code></p>
<p>For example. The following <span class="caps">CSS</span> hides all div children of an element with an id of <em>example3</em>.</p>
<pre><code>#example3 &gt;div {
    display: none;
}</code></pre>
<p>The we can say &#8220;if said element has been targetted then display them all&#8221;</p>
<pre><code>#example3:target &gt;div {
    display: block;
}</code></pre>
<p>So if you visiting #example3 you would see the divs, otherwise they will be hidden away.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a couple of examples over on <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/target">morethanseven.net/presents/target</a>.</p>
<p>These examples basically remove the need for Javascript implementations but I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;d actually use either of these. But you get the general idea. One thing about the examples was their simplicity compared with similar approaches though.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s already pretty well implemented according to this handy <a href="http://www.css3.info/modules/selector-compat">compatability table</a> from <a href="http://www.css3.info/">CSS3.info</a> and I would imagine an ideal candidate for <a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy Budd&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/">CSS2.2</a>.</p>

        Encoded Characters in CSS3 Generated Content
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">22 Jun 2007</span>

    <p>A quick, but hopefully informative post on something that took me a little time to work out and I thought might trip a few others up too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m playing with quite a bit of CSS3 at the moment for our <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">new company</a> site. It seemed like a good excuse to put into practice lots of progressive enhancement and the like and so far is going nicely if I do say so my self.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-content/">CSS3 Generated Content Module</a> has some nice little bits in and I decided to use it to put some icons after external link ala wikipedia (but with nicer icons). Actually what I wanted was simply an arrow and I didn&#8217;t really need an image for that did I?</p>
<p>Well my first try went a little something like this:</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "#8594;";
}</code></pre>
<p>Nope, no luck. By the time it hits the browser it&#8217;s not what I was looking for. I didn&#8217;t think old style named entities would work but what the heck?</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "&amp;rarr;";
}</code></pre>
<p>Nope. As I thought. No luck their either. I also tried the character itself (but forgot to put that in the first post &#8211; thanks <a href="http://joeclarke.org/weblogs/">Joe</a>) but again to no avail.</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "â†’";
}</code></pre>
<p>Some digging around and I managed to infer the correct syntax from some hidden away examples about something else.</p>
<pre><code>p a[href^="http:"]:after {
    content: "\2192";
}</code></pre>
<p>You need to use the Unicode encoding. Doh. Job done.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Jun 2007</span>

    <p>For both of you who care what I get up to during my work hours this post is for you. I&#8217;ve finally gotten involved in a new startup with a couple of friends. Look out for <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">hedgehog lab</a> related goings on in a Newcastle near you. We&#8217;ve got plans being drawn up as I type (multi-tasking) but a smattering of training and consultancy on web standards design and development and a very health dose of some of those new fangled online products (all with as many microformats as I can sneak in) sounds like fun to me.</p>
<p><a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/"><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgHedgehogLab.jpg" title="hedgehog lab" alt="hedgehog lab" /></a></p>
<p>Bye bye to all the people at TH_NK. It&#8217;s been great for two years and I&#8217;ll miss the cunning hit and run attacks on asp.net that have yielded some pretty good results. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll get more done without me being quite so obstinate!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just the impending job move that has been keeping me so busy. I finally, after much useful feedback and patience from <a href="http://thewatchmakerproject.com">Matt</a> got my first <a href="http://www.digital-web.com">Digital Web</a> article done: <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/apis_and_mashups/">APIs and Mashups For The Rest Of Us</a>. As the title suggests it&#8217;s a quick run through the various goings on, in particular on what I find so interesting about the concepts of Open APIs and this web of data thing. I even squeezed in some talk of <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/apis_and_mashups/comments/">Let me know what you think</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam</a> as well for a useful early proof read and to <a href="http://www.tiffehr.com/">Tiff</a> at Digital Web (who also has some interesting things to say on this here industry on her new blog, <a href="http://www.lostcog.com/">Lost Cog</a>.)</p>
<p>End of self reverential post. The list of <em>real</em> things I have to blog about is frankly too long to wait around. And it&#8217;s not helped by these <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">trips</a> to <a href="http://hackday.org">london</a> which frankly just give me even more to write about. Incase anyone is interested (and more to remind me), expect something on automated site testing, some musings and code (!) for doing useful things with microformats, some cool CSS3 (or is it CSS2.2 now?) tricks and something involving flickr which should actually be quite interesting if I get the time.</p>
