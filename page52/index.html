        HTML. An alternative to Word?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>When I&#8217;m writing code, be it <span class="caps">CSS</span>, Javascript, Ruby, whatever, I don&#8217;t like big bulky IDE&#8217;s. Give me <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or Vim any day. Going all freelance I now have the occasional need to produce nice documents and being in charge means I get to decide what I use to produce them. I never really liked working in Microsoft Word so decided against it. But rather than sensibly going for an obviously alternative I decided to just use <span class="caps">HTML</span>, or rather more specifically, <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOnlineDocs.png" title="An example of a current document" alt="An example of a current document" /></p>
<p>As an old time <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> I learned to love the simple text transformation language and it&#8217;s inclusion in the <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> apps made me smile and more likely to use them. Why use it over <span class="caps">HTML</span> you may ask? For me I think about <span class="caps">HTML</span> like a browser, as a tree of nodes. I end up spending quite a bit of time writing content then going backwards and wrapping what I just wrote in markup. This is fine for your typical site, but for writing documents it&#8217;s hard to get into a flow. With textile I can flow in one direction.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;m liking it alot. I can seperate content from presentation (Word styles are a myth), easily repurpose my content (text, html, pdf) and write documents in anything I like, including Word if I chose to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty good excuse to play with various bits of CSS3, including multi-columns, advanced layout, generated content and the various print offerings. Given I can control the rendering engine then produce a <span class="caps">PDF</span> to distribute I can use anything that the latest browser builds can deal with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not got all the workflow steps automated yet, I&#8217;m using Firefox to print documents to <span class="caps">PDF</span> (via Preview) at the moment which works fine but is still a manual process I can get rid of using something like <a href="http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/">css2xslfo</a> and <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">fop</a>. I&#8217;m also pretty sure the PDFs won&#8217;t be accessible, although the original markup certainly should be.</p>
<p>As I produce more complex documents I&#8217;ll likely miss things like automated table of contents generation, footnotes and page numbering but, then again, I can write that in Javascript (or on the server) if I so choose. I was impressed listening to HÃ¥kon Wium Lie at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a> about the process they used to format his last book using <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. I&#8217;m half tempted to spend time rolling all this together into a web app. It would be pretty good fun really; APIs, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">PDF</span>, some nice UI problems, etc. Only problem I see would be entering a market contested by Microsoft, Google, Sun and er, lots of others.</p>

        Some Thoughts on Good Conferences to Attend - UK
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Jul 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2007/07/31/some-thoughts-on-good-conferences-to-attend/">Ben Metcalfe</a> just posted a run down of some thoughts on conferences to attend. With all my travels this year I thought I&#8217;d join in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spend quite a bit of time this year travelling the UK for various get togethers, conferences, meetups and the like and had great fun doing so. I go mainly because nowhere else do I find quite such a critical mass of smart interesting people to have a pint with and discuss the intricacies of the web. For 2007, in roughly chronological order: <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/">WebDD</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a>, <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps</a>, <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com">Highland Fling</a>, Refresh Edinburgh, <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a>, <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hackday</a>. I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a>, Future of Web Apps (again) and possibly <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com">Future of Mobile</a> and a Rails meetup in London as well to finish off the year.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go on about how cool <a href="http://barcamp.org/">Barcamp</a> was. I actually think the whole unconference thing sits alongside the more formal conference scene quite nicely rather than acting as a direct challenge. Safe to say if you have yet to make a Barcamp then be on the lookout (although if you could not pick brighton please. I really want to go and it&#8217;s going to be hard enough to get tickets anyway!)</p>
<p>Highland Fling was excellent. Alan did a bang up job of picking a pretty focused topic and getting a gang of safe hands in to do the talking. Everything seemed to follow on from the previous talk, or catch a thread only touched on earlier in the day. This turned out to be down to the specific topic rather than some pre-conference collusion which I thing bodes well for other such topic centric mini-conferences. It was all rounded off (as all conferences must be) with a rousing talk from <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> and a panel chaired by <a href="http://adactio.com/">Jeremy <del>Paxman</del> <ins>Keith</ins></a>.</p>
<p>@media is still the daddy of the UK web standards scene. Personally I want more advanced materials and I&#8217;d love to see more audience interaction, but the scale of it makes that a little difficult I acknowledge. I&#8217;ll keep going as long as I learn something new and come away feeling a little bit inspired. I&#8217;ll be going next year. Maybe it&#8217;s not going to hit the heights of the very first @media a couple of years back but that was my first trip out into the world. Oh, and <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/">patrick</a> throws good parties in pubs with beer.</p>
<p>I think dConstruct is basically a grown up Highland Fling. It was great fun last year so here&#8217;s hoping it&#8217;s as much fun this year. Again, the idea of a particular topic is in place. I&#8217;m still thinking about <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmediaAjax/">@media Ajax</a> if I can get enough work together to pay for it (note to people trying to keep up &#8211; I now <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">work for myself as a freelancer</a>) and I have a sneaking suspicion I&#8217;ll want to get along to <a href="http://www.future-of-mobile.com/">Future of Mobile</a> in a couple of months too.</p>
<p>My plan for next year is to try and get out of the country and hopefully to some of the events in the US and Europe that offer something different. <a href="sxsw.com/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> is an obvious choice, but I&#8217;d be interested in any other ideas on top of Ben&#8217;s list. I&#8217;d also like to think in a year of so I might even end up talking at some nice event or other &#8211; but I need to pick a topic and stick to it I reckon instead of flitting between whatever I feel like that afternoon. Oh and probably practice.</p>

        Nabaztag REST API
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Jul 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m having quite a bit of fun with my rabbit, <em>cambridge</em>, at the moment. Their were a number of projects at <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a> involving the ever so cute <a href="http://nabaztag.com">Nabaztag</a> and I had a feeling I&#8217;d probably go home and adopt one. The idea of a rabbit with APIs was simple too much fun.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgNabaztag.jpg" title="Nabaztag" alt="Nabaztag" /></p>
<p>The Nabaztag <span class="caps">API</span> docs can be found in two places (the rest of the site unfortunately has a number of issues when it comes to finding information easily); in the <a href="http://help.nabaztag.com/fiche.php?langue=3&amp;fiche=29#none">help section</a> and on the <a href="http://api.nabaztag.com/docs/home.html"><span class="caps">API</span> site</a>. The latter are much better than the former by the way.</p>
<p>Lots of people have already been hacking on the wireless rabbit. Their are some good tools over on the <a href="http://nabaztools.sourceforge.net/">Nabaztag Sourceforge project</a>, a handy <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/nabaztag/">Ruby module</a> and a <a href="http://pear.php.net/pepr/pepr-proposal-show.php?id=463">prospective</a> <a href="http://tmp.lfms.nl/nabaztag/"><span class="caps">PEAR</span> module</a> for <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting more and more into the ideas behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"><span class="caps">REST</span></a> recently and one thing that disappointed me a litte was the <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">RPC</span> style Nabaztag <span class="caps">API</span> (note to anyone thinking <span class="caps">REST</span> simply means using a <span class="caps">GET</span> request rather than something like <span class="caps">SOAP</span> or <span class="caps">XML</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span>, it doesn&#8217;t). I couldn&#8217;t help seeing PUTs to ears and POSTs to the mouth.</p>
<p>Inspired a little by <a href="http://www.aralbalkan.com/">Arals</a> <a href="http://aralbalkan.com/994">Bunny Talk</a> I&#8217;ve started implementing parts of the <span class="caps">API</span> in a RESTful manner, and used my <span class="caps">API</span> abstraction layer to build a similar application.</p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/">morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/</a> and send me a message (via my rabbit obviously) or, er, play with <em>cambridges</em> ears (he likes that). At the moment the <span class="caps">API</span> is configured only for my rabbit, although you can download the source code and run it yourself if you like. It requires PHP5 at the moment as one of the required modules is PHP5 only. But you are using <a href="http://gophp5.org/">PHP5 now</a> aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to use the form you can access the <span class="caps">API</span> directly. Here are a couple of examples using curl:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/ears/left</code></pre>

<pre><code>curl -X 'PUT' http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/ears/left/13</code></pre>

<pre><code>curl -X 'POST' -d "message" http://morethanseven.net/presents/nabaztag/mouth</code></pre>
<p>Their&#8217;s a litte documentation in the source. I&#8217;ll add more methods, more documentation and maybe make an <span class="caps">API</span> anyone with a Nabaztag can use by authenticating either as I need it or if people actually want it. Let me know what you think (via the rabbit obviously!)</p>

        Ruby on Rails on Nokia N800
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Jul 2007</span>

    <p>My latest job has allowed me to get back into playing with <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a>, something I&#8217;ve been meaning to do for a year or so. Having got everything up to date and installed on my virtual server and on my laptop I couldn&#8217;t resist seeing if I could get it going on my <a href="http://www.nseries.com/products/n800">N800</a>.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are mainly that the idea of a wireless web server in my pocket is pretty intriguing. Think about it. If you&#8217;re at an event with Wi-Fi you can just point people to an IP address and hey presto they have access to your details, or a set of photos, or whatever you want to show them. I&#8217;ve also got nginx installed, but I&#8217;m not as yet that up on running python or <span class="caps">PHP</span> behind it on the N800. So, no need to carry around the laptop. OK, maybe it&#8217;s just me and all this going to web conferences? We&#8217;ll have to see if I actually knock up anything useful for the next conference and see. Saving that I&#8217;ve been travelling quite a bit recently and it&#8217;s handy when reading a Rails book to be able to try out the examples.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that you can indeed <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kwe/484269853/">install Ruby and Rails on the N800</a>, although their isn&#8217;t much information around and non of it worked exactly as stated for me &#8211; hence this post.</p>
<p>I followed along with a <a href="http://www.digitalknk.com/2007/05/27/howto-ruby-on-rails-on-your-nokia-n800/">pretty good tutorial</a>, although I already had Red Pill Mode, XTerm and <span class="caps">SSH</span> installed. Ruby is also now available in the <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/ruby185/">Garage</a>.</p>
<p>The crux of the post is that you can find the required packages, in particular for Gem, <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/">here</a>. But unfortunately that is were the problems start. I ran into exactly the same problem as described in the comments in the above post, on <a href="http://railsgrunt.com/2007/5/14/installing-ruby-on-rails-on-the-n800">this blog post</a> and on this <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/">Internet Tablet Talk</a> <a href="http://www.internettablettalk.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5442&amp;page=2">forum thread</a>. Specifically, Gem hanging, crashing or returning a segmentation fault in the yaml.rb file on line 133.</p>
<p>The problem appears to be (this is me guessing here) with gem and the N800 being able download all the info for Gem to update it&#8217;s package list. The solution, or rather a suitable workaround, is to download the individual gems yourself to the local file system or a memory card and then install them from there. You can get all the Rails gems <a href="http://pierre.droids-corp.org/maemo/gems/">here</a>. A quick script/server later and I had the familiar Rails welcome screen on port 3000. This should in theory work for oher gems as well. You can either download them directly or use Gem on a local machine and them move the files across via bluetooth or <span class="caps">USB</span>.</p>

        A round-up

    <span class="post-date">11 Jul 2007</span>

    <p>Being busy is to be expected with this new start-up malarkey but whoa. The problem is I have even more ideas for real posts or articles (the type you research, play around with, then write properly) and, for the next few weeks, not the time to do them justice. I&#8217;ll be back with gusto when I find the time. In the interim here are a few things from the last month or so I consider <em>cool</em>.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I has <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/en/index.html">Nabaztag</a>! Sorry, but I couldn&#8217;t resist after <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a>. Expect <span class="caps">API</span> hacking and silly photos on flickr aplenty.</li>
	<li>Oh, <a href="http://hackday.org">Hackday</a> was an absolute blast. Thanks to Matt, Ian, Tom and the cast of hundreds.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;m working on a cool Ruby on Rails app in the real world, up here in Newcastle no less.</li>
	<li><a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007">@media</a> was, yet again, fab. A (very) late shout to Patrick and the umper lumpers. Can I make it to @media Ajax?</li>
	<li><a href="http://refreshnewcastle.org/">Refresh Newcastle</a> got a minor update with more flickr and upcoming goodness. Tag things <em>refreshnewcastle</em> for some lovin.</li>
	<li><a href="http://hedgehoglab.com">hedgehoglab.com</a> has a few more pages, a <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/training/survey">survey on web training needs</a> and more microformats than you can shake a stick at.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ll be at <a href="http://dconstruct.org">dconstruct</a> (just). Another jigsaw piece of my increasingly bloody minded attempt to get to as many UK web get-togethers as possible.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ll be along to <a href="http://rubyandrails.org/usergroups/newcastle/">ncl.rb</a> tomorrow night (thursday) and in the pub afterwards if anyone is around. Their have been a few good events in Newcastle recently, only some of which I&#8217;ve managed to get along to. I&#8217;m considering getting an <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org/">Open Coffee</a> do up and running in Newcastle as well. If anyone is interested let me know.</li>
