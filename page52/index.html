    <span class="post-date">07 May 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://andybudd.com">Andy</a> gave a great thought provoking presentation (exactly what conference presentations should be) at the recent <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">Highland Fling</a> shindig on the future of <span class="caps">CSS</span> which he&#8217;s written up into a good thought provoking blog post on <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2007/05/css22/index.php">CSS2.2</a></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>As web standards developers we want new toys! I took to <span class="caps">CSS</span> because <em>it made sense</em> set against the madness of table based layouts, not necessarily because it appeared easy or flexible. <span class="caps">CSS</span> has turned out to be hugely flexible, but some of that flexibility has come at the expense of some weird and wonderful and successful techniques. I love this ingenuity, I&#8217;d like to think that the original <span class="caps">CSS</span> specification allowed for this cleverness in real world use.</p>
<p>CSS3 has stalled. CSS3 is trying to solve a whole host of massive problems that others are better placed to comment on, but I&#8217;d love to hear some comment from members of the working group. If I&#8217;ve missed a regular blog by a working group member please leave a comment and let me know.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a real believer in open standards and I think that it&#8217;s this issue that worries me more about the pace of <span class="caps">CSS</span> development. Yes, I want new toys, or more specifically I want to be more efficient (yes rounded corners, I&#8217;m looking at you) but actually, I&#8217;d rather have a good CSS3 spec than a fast and loose one. But the immenent fight between Flash/Adobe and Silverlight/Microsoft is showing how productive huge commercial companies can be when it wants to get something done. Both are introducing interesting new tools and allowing for what could be improvements to usability (or horribly confusing interfaces but hey). <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">HTML</span> should be the glue that binds all this together in a web where everything plays nicely together. But if <span class="caps">CSS</span> provides too little or too late then this is put in doubt. And if <span class="caps">CSS</span> falls I dont see microformats, rdf, html5 or whatever making a real dent &#8211; and I really want a semantic web (upper <strong>and</strong> lower case).</p>
<h3>The Solution?</h3>
<p>Well, I&#8217;d like to say the solution isn&#8217;t <em>Browser Wars II &#8211; A good idea this time?</em></p>
<p>Andy&#8217;s suggestion of an interim step (or steps) between now and CSS3 modules raises a problem. If the working group do the work then it takes their eye further off getting CSS3 modules out. If they don&#8217;t, will they accept suggestions from outside? Will outsiders be able to grok the whole standardisation process?</p>
<p>What we need is a commercial company with lots of smart people and lots of cash &#8211; with a track record of working with standards. A member of the W3C would be a plus. Ideally they should have something invested in the web as a platform, maybe even in a smarter, cleverer, semantic web.</p>
<p>Google to the rescue maybe? If you&#8217;re really cynical you could see Silverlight as an end run around Google&#8217;s apparent dominance of the web as a platform. Lock content away in proprietary silos and traditional search becomes less appealing? And surely Google has lots to gain from the long term adoption of anything that increases the semantic nature of the web. If <span class="caps">CSS</span> is a battleground then maybe they need to come out and make a stand(ard)?</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/authoritative-hcards-authority-in-microformats/">authority in microformats</a> and as a result been taking a closer look at <a href="http://microid.org">microID</a>.</p>
<p>The situation I want to find a solution for is; If their are lots of published hcards for a given person they might be different, either out of date or more sinisterly fraudulent. If I do a search for contact details, lets say using the <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">technorati hcard search engine</a>, how do I know which one is to be trusted?</p>
<p>If I publish an hcard on <a href="http://morethanseven.net">my site</a> using the following markup, including a microID using the included email and url details to form the hash.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:a52b4f86cfa4190b53634d99198c0f56970c8d83"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://morethanseven.net" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@morethanseven.net
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If the hcard search engine reads that hcard on the morethanseven.net domain it could check the hash in the vcard against doings it&#8217;s own hash with the specified email address and url (checking the url is the same as the one on which the vcard lives). &#8220;Ah ha&#8221;. It can say. This looks like an authoritive hcard.</p>
<p>This does however raise a couple of issues. In order for the search engine or external reader to be able to create its hash you have to include the email in your hcard. I&#8217;m also not sure it does solve the issue of evil me:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div 
   class="vcard microid-mailto+http:sha1:40b46e5c349453bddd0dbd022fb33488494699cb"&gt;
   &lt;h2 class="fn"&gt;evil gareth rushgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://spammer.com" class="url" rel="me"&gt;
      spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;a href="mailto:gareth@spammer.com" class="email"&gt;
      gareth@spammer.com
   &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Assuming the above is published on spammer.com then I&#8217;m sunk. It&#8217;s another authorative hcard with the same name, in this case <em>my</em> name. Of course therein lies another problem, when we name our children we tend to just do it on a whim, we even copy names we like from other people! And we change or subvert these names when we dont like them with nick names and the like. Domain names are unique so we avoid this problem.</p>
<p>So, a possible solution does present itself; using the uniqueness of domain names combined with the fact that most people aren&#8217;t evil spammers. Lets postulate a search engine finds lots of hcards for a given name. Most of these hcards probably point back to the url of the entity they are describing (so most hcards on the web describing me point back to this site). We can then check if one of the hcards is from that domain, and if it has a valid microID. In other words we use the lazy web to identify the most likely location of an authorative hcard.</p>

        Authoritative hCards - Authority in microformats
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering lots of potential uses for <a href="http://microformats.org">microformats</a> of late and came up on one thing I thought worth asking what people thought; namely the issue of authority in microformatted data.</p>
<p><a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> provide a very interesting <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/">Microformats search engine</a> that allows you to search for a person and get back their contact details via hcards that it knows about. For instance try doing a <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/rushgrove">search for me</a> and you get seven results (ironic given the domain name), try with one of those <a href="http://adactio.com">famous people</a> and you get <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/contact/search/jeremy+keith">lots more</a>. This poses a problem, what is the various hcard disagree?</p>
<p>You can always look at the publication date but this might not be enough. I could publish an hcard with incorrect data for anyone right now on this site and it would be more recent that the other, possibly correct, information already available on the web. Note that this isn&#8217;t a problem with Microformats per ce, more an ever present problem with the web. It&#8217;s just that Microformats make the matter more of a potential issue.</p>
<p>Is their a need for the ability to provide an authoritative hCard, or other Microformat instance? One that can always be trusted? If I publish an hcard of my details I&#8217;d like to think the latest version of that would be the most trustworthy. But how do you make a claim of ownership over a piece of data on the web (microformatted or not)? And for some of this data do you need a way of deciding who has access to it and who does not in a standard manner?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty interested in the issue of identity at the moment, spurred on by the likes of <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID</a> and <a href="http://microid.org/">MicroID</a>. I&#8217;m wondering if their isn&#8217;t some clever cross over here? Sites like <a href="http://claimid.com/">ClaimID</a> are doing some things in this space already so we&#8217;ll have to see.</p>

        Working example of Microformats as an API

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2007</span>

    <p><a href="http://allinthehead.com/">Drew</a> posted a while ago asking <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/301/can-your-website-be-your-api">can-your-website-be-your-api</a>. The simple idea is that you just might be able to live without a dedicated <span class="caps">API</span> in favour of good use of microformats.</p>
<p>It also turns out <a href="http://tantek.com/">Tantek</a> has also been on the case with his presentation <a href="http://tantek.com/presentations/20040928sdforumws/semantic-xhtml.html">Can your website be your <span class="caps">API</span>? &#8211; Using semantic <span class="caps">XHTML</span> to show what you mean</a> and</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glennjones.net">Glenn</a> has <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk/ViewSession.aspx?SessionID=60">spoken on the subject too</a> at <a href="http://www.webdd.org.uk">WebDD</a> and <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">BarCamp</a>.</p>
<p>This has interested me for a while and I&#8217;ve finally gotten around to writing some code, in fact I wrote the bulk of it during <a href="http://thehighlandfling.com/2007/">The Highand Fling</a> and then the rest before the <a href="http://refreshedinburgh.com/">Refresh</a> event after I got to te venue an hour early.</p>
<p>I used Drew&#8217;s <a href="http://allinthehead.com/hkit">hKit</a> for the microformat parsing so everything that follows is PHP5 only I&#8217;m afraid. The also means I dont have a working example on this server at the moment but you can <a href="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/downloads/microformatsapi/microformatsapi.zip">grab the code</a> and try it out yourself. It also makes use of a couple of <a href="http://pear.php.net"><span class="caps">PEAR</span></a> modules; <span class="caps">PEAR</span> <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Validate">Validate</a> and <span class="caps">PEAR</span> <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request">HTTP_Request</a>.</p>
<p>At the moment I&#8217;ve worked on a simple hCard example. It demonstrates the idea of a website exposing methods based on the presense of microformats, plus using that exposed method to extract the information we&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>First we create objects for the parser and the website:</p>
<pre><code>$parser = new hKit;
$website = new Website('http://morethanseven.net',$parser);</code></pre>
<p>Then we&#8217;ll ask what methods the website exposes:</p>
<pre><code>$website-&gt;expose();</code></pre>
<p>In this example we get back an array of the available methods, in this case <em>getContacts</em>. Then just as an example lets print out some contact details:</p>
<pre><code>foreach ($website-&gt;getContacts() as $contact) {
   echo $contact-&gt;getFN();
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a very early release, more of a proof of concept and as such their is no documentation and only a portion of hCard is supported. Hell, their&#8217;s not even a name beginning with h! Having said that I have a plan for a little project to kick the tyres and so I&#8217;l l be adding to it and hopfully have a proper release at some point.</p>
<p>The plan is to introduce methods like getReviews, getEvents, etc. which allow for the extraction of the relevant details. The part I find most interesting however is the idea of the expose method &#8211; asking a web page if it has an <span class="caps">API</span>, and if it does then what information you can extract automagically. If you&#8217;re interested let me know what you think.</p>

    <p>Ok, so I&#8217;ve been shopping again but I&#8217;ll try and make this post a little more useful that <em>oh, look at my shiny new toy</em>.</p>
<p>I decided that what I was really missing to help with my <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> addiction and growing interest in the mobile web was a shiny new Nokia N800 Internet Tablet.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgN800.jpg" title="Nokia N800 Internet Tablet" alt="Nokia N800 Internet Tablet" /></p>
<p>I cant really write a fair review at the moment as I&#8217;ve only just got my mits on it so that will have to save for later. All I can think at the moment is <em>&#8220;Oh, shiny&#8221;</em>. What I will do is list the software I installed on it from the start, partly to demonstrate what you can get on it, partly to link to thinks I found useful and mostly to remind me if and when I need to do it again.</p>
