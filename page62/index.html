    <p>On occasion I even surprise myself. Sometimes you just need to geek. Rob at work was discussing his ideal device, basically something that would read text based <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds to him while in the bath in the morning. Lazy I know.</p>
 <p>I thought to myself <em>That cant be too difficult</em> and I&#8217;ve never played with any text to speach stuff before and off I went. A few hours later and I just got my Windows machine to read out the top story from this site.</p>
 <p>Python is so cool to just hack in. Did I mention that before? I&#8217;ve yet to do anything <em>real</em> in it, but playing around with code is nice. Anyway, on with a solution;</p>
 <p>Lots of things to install first. As mentioned I used Windows, in this case so I could access the Win32 Speech <span class="caps">API</span>. I looked at using <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> on Unix but left that for now. Tools of choice were <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> 2.4 with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">Win32 extensions</a>. A couple of Python modules do most of the work. First up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyTTS</a> which deals with the text to speach and <span class="caps">SAPI</span> integration. Next comes the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module. I&#8217;d heard this mentioned by <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/08/08/ydn">Simon</a> over on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/python/python-rss.html">Yahoo Python developer network</a> and it really is nice.</p>
 <p>The rest was easy.<code>&lt;pre&gt;import pyTTS
import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse("http://morethanseven.net/rss")
tts = pyTTS.Create()
tts.Speak(d['items'][0].description)&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
 <p>Ok, so this isn&#8217;t an application. Just a proof of concept but you get the idea and I dont really want or need this app anyway. Why then? because I thought I could. Oh, and Python&#8217;s interactive prompt is so cool. I want one for everything.</p>

    <p>Well, Christian&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.beginningjavascript.com">Begining Javascript with <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting and Ajax</a> is out and, as of writing this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590596803/202-8465886-9794241?v=glance&#38;n=266239">Amazon UK</a> only have four copies left so hopefully that&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
 <p>A quick competition on the site peaked my amusometer and I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

 <p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/newcoverforbeginningjavascript/">flickr</a> for more hopefully.</p>
 <p><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Everyone</a> <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">who</a> <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/journal/">is</a> <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">everyone</a> already resides at <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!, with more <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">recent</a> <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">movers</a> that you can shake a stick at.  I&#8217;d just like to make a couple of observations:</p>
 <p>Both <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/297/joining-yahoo">Drew</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/07/12/joining-yahoo/">Stuart</a> posted posts titled <strong>Joining Yahoo!</strong>. The brain washing obviously starts in the interviews so you have been warned!</p>
 <p>The upcoming <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon">BarCampLondon</a> event is being held at the Yahoo offices in London. I&#8217;m thinking about going along, but I&#8217;m scared Yahoo might not let all those talented developers leave on the sunday?</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m working on some redesign work for one of my under maintained sites at the moment, with something of a redesign in the works. It seemed a good opportunity to play more with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><span class="caps">YUI</span></a>, the Yahoo User Interface Library, which I&#8217;d had a peak at before and heard nice things about (sorry, I like the long namespaces).</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve nothing finished yet past a proof of concept, but I thought a couple of lines of javascript wouldn&#8217;t go a miss. Nothing fancy mind, just some nice bits I like so far.</p>
 <p>The case in point was wanting to add event handlers to an unknown number of links within an unordered list.</p>
 <p>First off a quick, clever, one liner. <em>onAvailable</em> checks for the availability of the object (if you remove the quotes) or an object with a specified id in this case. It executes the callback function, <em>init</em> in this case, when the condition is true.</p>
<div><code>YAHOO.util.Event.onAvailable("iList", init);</code></div>
 <p>Moments later we have events added to all the links.</p>
<div><code>&lt;pre&gt;
function init() {
   var links = document.getElementById("iList").getElementsByTagName("A");
   YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(links, "click", clickCallback);
}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></div>
 <p>Again you just throw in whatever you happen to be working with (in this case an array returned by <em>getElementsByTagName</em>) and everything just gets dealt with. I originally had a <em>for</em> loop, iterating over the links and adding events, then I worked out <span class="caps">YUI</span> just did it all for me if I let it. I like that. I <strong>could</strong> have done it myself. <span class="caps">YUI</span> would have let me and not complained. But if I want to delve a bit I can find cool, quick, clean ways of doing the same thing. I refactored my code, with the help of <span class="caps">YUI</span> in ten minutes. I like that, but I think I said that.</p>

    <span class="post-date">19 Jul 2006</span>

    <p>Last year I missed out on <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/">dconstruct</a>, this year I sat and watched the timer tick down. Which didn&#8217;t help hugely as a fair few other people were doing the same thing and the site went into what appeared to be a javascript induced page request meltdown. Oh well. Everything worked out in the end, I paid my money for myself and a <a href="http://sarat.xcelens.co.uk/">colleague</a> to attend and so did 348 or so other people and it&#8217;s now sold out. Why do I get a feeling I could name half the people attending? and be about right?</p>
 <p>Their will again I&#8217;m sure be more <em>web conference as trendy holiday for web geeks and nothing else</em> conversations, but again I dont care. I haven&#8217;t had the chance to do any holidays at all for ages unless you count <a href="http://carsonworkshops.com/summit">Carson</a> and <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a>, and I learn lots again as well.</p>
 <p>Well, I&#8217;ve fired up the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/dconstruct/">dConstruct feed thing</a> again, although I need to update the codebase with the latest version as it lacks the bits I added (like new post indicators and the stats) more recently. Give me a week or so.</p>
 <p>Much more interestingly, and entertainingly, I have to recommend the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/">dConstruct Podcast</a>. I listen to podcasts on occasion, always grab talks from conferences and the like and subscribed because it was their. I didn&#8217;t expect it to be a <strong>rock and roll fourteen minutes of comedy genius</strong>. Everyone who&#8217;s been to one of <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy&#8217;s</a> talks or sessions will know he&#8217;s an enthusiastic and engaging presenter, but little did we know about the comic inside. Ok, so you need to know everyone, so maybe it&#8217;s a bit incestuous, but it&#8217;s still funny. Through in some more info about the upcoming event and everyone will be laughing. More of the same please.</p>
 <p>On the web design podcast front; anyone know of any good magazine style programmes on web design and development? or even better a weekly comic look at the industry?</p>

    <p>I always take ages to get photos off my camera. It&#8217;s like the sort of delay you would get if you sent them off to be developed. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve finally sorted out my <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> photos and uploaded a few to flickr. Have a look if you feel so inclined. I&#8217;ve included a few below, mainly because these ones made me chuckle:</p>
 <p>A look of sheer horror if ever their was one from <a href="http://splintered.co.uk">Patrick</a>.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/65/190869172_a3a229458d_m.jpg" alt="Patrick H Lauke on the big screen" /></p>
 <p>Is &#8220;Chris Wilson&#8221;: not the spitting image of He Man?</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/63/190868288_530626e765_m.jpg" alt="Chris Wilson" /></p>
 <p>If this isn&#8217;t caption competition material I dont know what is. <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm</a> was most definately <em>the man</em> that night.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/59/190872439_ca8f880df2_m.jpg" alt="Norm. nuff said." /></p>
 <p>Ah. The famous straw incident. Featuring <a href="http://theintranetblog.blogspot.com/">Nic</a> and an awful lot of straws.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/46/190871829_2445000f09_m.jpg" alt="A drink very very full of straws" /></p>
 <p>And I&#8217;m still trying to decide what was funnier; the fact <a href="http://htmldog.com">Patrick</a> set up a bird bath in the middle of the pub, or the fact it took him and <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com">Meri</a> quite a while with the instructions to put it together.</p>

 <p>Some people have been saying that the socialising is getting in the way of the learning and sundry at these conferences. I&#8217;ve got to disagree. You just cant ignore the socialising, not when it&#8217;s this much fun. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the message doesn&#8217;t get drilled home too.</p>
