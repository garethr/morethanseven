        Unit Testing CSS - Looking for a Solution
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Oct 2008</span>

    <blockquote>
<p>I think it&#8217;s an epic failure of web standards that <span class="caps">CSS</span> is the only essentially untestable technology invented in last decade &#8211; <a href="http://twitter.com/t_a_w/statuses/957359524">Tomasz</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talking today on Twitter with <a href="http://twitter.com/t_a_w">Tomasz</a> got me thinking again about one of those problems that I come back to once in a while. Unit testing <span class="caps">CSS</span>. <span class="caps">CSS</span> development is a pain, even with some sort of <a href="http://natbat.net/2008/Sep/28/css-systems/">system</a>. Admit it. I actually like <span class="caps">CSS</span> most of the time but it&#8217;s still painful at times. Hopefully with that out of the way you feel better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>unit testing is a method of testing that verifies the individual units of source code are working properly. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All testing past simple validation of <span class="caps">CSS</span> seems to be done visually at present.<br />
Thinking about this from the point of view of <span class="caps">CSS</span> seems straight forward, but turns out not to be so for a variety of reasons. The problem lies in the cascading and compounding nature of the beast. Each individual <span class="caps">CSS</span> rule might do something which is self contained, but the chances on a real site are probably slim. For instance:</p>
<pre>body {
   font-size: 100%;
}
p {
   font-size: 2em;
}</pre>
<p>What is the size of the font size of a paragraph? It turns out it depends. Not just on more than one unit of source code (we have two rules here) but also on things like the browser. And how do we get this font size from a browser in the first place? I generally dislike <a href="http://selenium.openqa.org/">Selenium</a> but does it provide a mechanism for getting at the calculated <span class="caps">DOM</span> attribute values? Do we have to interface directly with a browser at a lower level?</p>
<p><a href="http://wxmozilla.sourceforge.net/">wxMozilla</a>, <a href="http://wxmozilla.sourceforge.net/">wxWebKit</a> or maybe <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pywebkitgtk/">pywebkitgtz</a> might prove useful, but I&#8217;m not sure at what level they operate. What I&#8217;m imagining here is maybe something like (excuse the Python, hopefully you get the idea):</p>
<pre>def test_text_size_is_12px(self):
    response = fetch_with_browser('http://www.google.com')
    self.assertEquals(12, response.search("p").fontSize    </pre>
<p>So we could use <span class="caps">CSS</span> selectors (ie. <em>p</em>) to find elements and then assert various <span class="caps">DOM</span> properties (ie. <em>fontSize</em>) are equal to values we specify. The magic is in getting access to those calculated <span class="caps">DOM</span> attribute values from an actual browser engine.</p>
<p>Another approach would seem to be looking at visual rendering and comparing against a known good version. This seems to be something that the <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roc/archives/2005/03/visual_regressi.html">Mozilla folks got up to a while back</a> to test different browser versions. Their are a few tools that might help us out here too; <a href="http://www.browsercam.com/">BrowserCam</a> provides a paid for service, <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/">Webkit2png</a> is a handy command line script I&#8217;ve had fun with in the past and <a href="http://iecapt.sourceforge.net/">IECapt</a> appears to be a similar beast for Internet Explorer. <a href="http://cutycapt.sourceforge.net/">CutyCapt</a> is another cross platform webkit based utility. I can see a few gotchas lurking here. Animations or slow loading javascript would obviously throw this into disarray. But disabling these in the browser might get up somewhere. How to compare images  produced I&#8217;m not yet sure, but I reasons someone reading this might have a good idea?</p>
<p>As the title would suggest this post does not contain the answer, only a few useful links and two possible approaches to the problem. The questions at this stage are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Does any of this exist already? If so who do we need to cuddle up to to get access to it?</li>
	<li>Are any of the technical hurdles to either of the approaches mentioned above insurmountable? If not what is the best solution?</li>
	<li>Does anyone except me and Tomasz even want this?</li>
</ul>
<p>I reason their are a fair few things that would be needed to make this first practical and later standard; nice APIs, run times in various languages, and working out whether or not it actually helps <span class="caps">CSS</span> development to name but a few. But right now I&#8217;d go for a limited proof of concept that works on my machine. If anyone has any links to thinks that might be good starting points please let me know. Other ideas welcome as well.</p>
<p>One last thing; <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/ajaxians-join-mozilla-creating-developer-tools">Mozilla&#8217;s latest employees</a> are looking at the whole spectrum of developer tools. I&#8217;d love for them to start with something like this.</p>

        Google App Engine PyUnit Test Runner

    <span class="post-date">11 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m starting to play around with using <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a> again for small projects. It&#8217;s great for simple, somewhat throwaway apps as long as you don&#8217;t need anything too fancy. Actually all I want really is long running processes but I digress.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m increasingly writing test suites as well for even small projects and was missing the convenience of the Django test runner for running them against App Engine code. So I&#8217;ve spent a little time writing a simple test running script to use for non-Django Python projects. I&#8217;ve posted it over on the <a href="http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/app-engine-test-runner/">App Engine Cookbook</a> for anyone else who might want to do the same.</p>
<p>I ended up writing something myself as I couldn&#8217;t find anything else which quite met my needs, so it&#8217;s the typical programmers itch code and as such is provided as <em>works for me</em> software. The other approaches out their didn&#8217;t quite meet my needs but might be useful to know about if you want to start testing your apps.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/nose-gae/">Nose <span class="caps">GAE</span></a> uses the nose testing framework which I&#8217;m less familiar with.</li>
	<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/gaeunit/"><span class="caps">GAE</span> Unit</a> uses PyUnit but presents it&#8217;s results in a browser rather than on the command line.</li>

    <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2008</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m busy experimenting with various blogging approaches at the moment, hence the short links I&#8217;ve been posting recently. Another type of post I thought I&#8217;d give a try to was the list of interesting things. I find this sort of thing strangely cathartic &#8211; if nothing else by writing down the things I&#8217;m thinking about I won&#8217;t forget to spend time playing with them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I still need to play around some more with Jabber/<span class="caps">XMPP</span>. I tried a little time ago to install a server locally on my Mac with only some success. I&#8217;ve now got a load of linux virtual images handy which might make that easier. What I would really like to see is a dirt simple <span class="caps">XMPP</span> server that you can use for local development. Something like <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/morbid/0.8.2">Morbid</a>. I&#8217;m just not sure I have the time to build one.</li>
	<li>Which brings me on to virtualisation. I&#8217;m more convinced than ever that sand boxing different local environments is a good idea. I now have a stack of VMWare images set up for configuring.</li>
	<li>It turns out <a href="http://blog.socklabs.com/cufp2008.html">Yahoo used Erlang</a> under the hood for some part of the new <a href="http://del.icio.us">Delicious</a> I&#8217;m still pretty interested in actually doing something with Erlang, though what I&#8217;m not yet sure. I&#8217;ve been kicking round an idea for ages involving logging which might fit the bill.</li>
	<li>I talked at barcampbrighton recently about debugging tools for django (and more broadly any development environment) that you need once you have a reasonable sized team. I&#8217;ve been busy packaging some of the tools I mentioned. I&#8217;ll either turn it into an article somewhere, multiple blog posts and/or hopefully get some code released on google code some time soon.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> documentation system used by Django for the <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/">1.0 documentation</a> is pretty nifty. I&#8217;m investigating it for use at work at the moment.</li>
	<li>I&#8217;ve been a huge fan of Textile since I used Textpattern years ago for an earlier incarnation of this site. But recently I&#8217;ve had a few niggling issues around extensibility and slight differences in implementation. So I&#8217;m pondering using <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReStructuredText</a> for my writing duties. It appears to be more powerful, more flexible and inherently extensible.</li>

    <span class="post-date">27 Sep 2008</span>

    <p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a> lets you run virtual machines in headless mode. Which is pretty handy if you&#8217;re using a Linux VM to mirror your live environment. The strange thing is that it&#8217;s not enabled by default. To enable it you need to run the following on your console: <code>defaults write com.vmware.fusion fluxCapacitor -bool YES</code></p>
