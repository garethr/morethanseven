        A Typo? On this site?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2005</span>

    <p>Well, their are no doubt lots of typo&#8217;s on this site but I&#8217;m referring to the Ruby on Rails blogging application <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> (currently version 2.5.5)</p>
 <p>So far I have to say it&#8217;s quite nice. I&#8217;m only playing at the moment &#8211; the site you are currently reading (for those of you actually on the site, and not reading the feed) is a product of my <span class="caps">PHP</span> skills. Some of it I like (ie. the bits I wanted to write), others I&#8217;m not too sure about and well, it doesn&#8217;t do anything I cant be bothered to write. Which up until not hasn&#8217;t been a problem. But I&#8217;d still quite like live searching, categories and tags and all that malarkey.</p>
 <p>Browsing the usual supect sites the choice between using a bespoke system and an existing solution seems fairly split. <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">John Hicks</a> is always raving about <a href="http://www.textpattern.com">TextPattern</a> and saying nice things. You see lots of <a href="www.movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> fans and <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> fans but non to be fair I never really liked them. Maybe that was just me?</p>
 <p>It might be that all, especially WordPress and MovableType are pretty mature solutions and that I like something to hack on? So a custom self built solution seems the way to go? Or does it? With everything providing very similar featuresets &#8211; and differing only in a few important areas building something bespoke means 95% redesigning and rebuilding the wheel and maybe 5% innovation. Which is cool as a learning experience but I&#8217;m now in more of a get stuff done mood of late.</p>
 <p>I haven&#8217;t decided as yet one way or the other but Typo might just be the anwser. Small enough to hack, an excuse to learn Rails and featureful to boot.</p>

    <p>A somewhat grandiouse title but hey, dont you just love it when things just work? A slow evening lead to following two tutorials at once, the outcome I now have <a href="http://andybudd.com">andy budd</a>&#8217;s fab <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2005/08/itunes_smart_playlists/index.php#more">iTunes playlists</a> set up and I have rails running on my host. Woo Hoo.</p>
 <p>I love working things out and generally dont mind things ending up not working even but sometimes it&#8217;s nice when everything takes only a small amount of time and effort and then works. A sense of acomplishment, and admiration, if you will.</p>
 <p>Oh, proof of the rails pudding: <a href="http://morethanseven.net:3000/">morethanseven.net:3000/</a><br />
WEBrick at the moment, FastCGI is for another day, hopefully soon. And before you ask, I didn&#8217;t just copy the source from a local install. Really.</p>
 <p>The tutorial I followed for that I grabbed from <a href="http://xmlareas.com/ruby-rails-howto.html">xmlareas.com/ruby-rails-howto.html</a> which might be of use on a range of reasonable shared hosting environments &#8211; though remember to remomve the temp directory as it will contain <span class="caps">LOTS</span> of files that may flag some hosting file limits.</p>
 <p>Makes me want to write some sort of how to articles on some subject or other. Question on a post card is what?</p>
 <p>So a big thanks for Andy&#8217;s rather geeky approach to cataloging music (my librarian housemate is going to love that) and to goldenratio (probably not a real name?) for the Rails article. Long live the Internet and all that.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2005</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been a practicing web designer/developer/whatever in Newcastle for over three years now and about a year ago I set up a mailing list to try and act as a useful resource, shamelessly stealing from <a href="http://brightonnewmedia.org">brightonnewmedia.org</a></p>
 <p>So was born <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a>.</p>
 <p>The grand plan was to find other people like me with an interest. Anyone I could learn new bits from and hopefully the utopian dream of everyone getting something out of particupating in a community. It&#8217;s been, I guess, something of a partialy something. Traffic goes up and down depending on, well I dont really know. Hopefully it&#8217;s been useful on occasion.</p>
 <p>One issue was I never really promoted it. So, with a little time on my hands rather than redesigning this site (again) I did a little work freshening up the website, adding a showcase of local designers personal sites in the process and the plan is to promote it a little. Hopefully get some more people on their and in particular some students from the local Uni&#8217;s &#8211; quite a few of which teach something along the lines of web design but approach it in wildly different ways &#8211; something I might write about next.</p>
 <p>Anyway, I guess the main aim is to get a snap shot of the industry and in particularly the people who make up the industry, in and around the North East. Are their people in their bedrooms going crazy <span class="caps">CSS</span> zen Garden designs? Are their any <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting leviathans? British web designers seem to be the cream of the crop, or at least make up a decent percentage of the cream (why do Standards based design analogies always end up being <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/web_standards_trifle.html">cake related</a>?), but where are the Northern designers, never mind the North East.</p>
 <p>Anyone else think differently? Let me know. Send me sites of designers and developers in and around the North East and I&#8217;ll post them into the <a href="http://www.newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a> site and we shall see.</p>

        unobtrusive javascript
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Aug 2005</span>

    <p>Lots of talk around at the moment about <a href="http://adactio.com/atmedia2005/">unobtrusive</a>  <a href="http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/articles/goodpractices.php">javascript</a> on the usual websites and <a href="http://designersinhouse.com">discussion</a> <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/list.html ">lists</a>. However alot of people, maybe outside the inner circles, are still finding old school examples of inline code on out of date pages.</p>
 <p>So here&#8217;s my tuppence. I guess the more websites that post new, up to date, examples and reasoning the better?</p>
 <p>The premise is pretty simple. In the same way as controlling formating with tables and having everything being mixed up in one .htm file is frowned upon as simply being too much work &#8211; dealing with lots of inline snippets of javascript raises the same problems. Namely being time consuming to update and maintain.</p>
 <p>The solution is to keep <span class="caps">ALL</span> your javascript in separate .js files, and that includes removing things like <code>href="javascript:"</code> or <code>onclick=</code>. The first question is therefor how &#8211; when I started looking down this route I found a simple answer hard to come by, having to look at more complex examples and reverse engineer them.</p>
 <p>The following is the method I&#8217;m using at the moment. It may have issues I&#8217;m unaware &#8211; if your a javascript guru let me know. The examples are from the fluidflash page on this site, see it in action at <a href="http://www.morethanseven.net/fluidflash">www.morethanseven.net/fluidflash</a></p>
 <p>We first I set up an initialisation function:</p>


<pre><code>
function init() {
    if (!document.getElementById) return false;

    liquid = document.getElementById("iNavLiquid");

    liquid.onclick = liquidChangeClass;
}
</code></pre>
 <p>This sets the onclick event on the element with the id <code>iNavLiquid</code> that will trigger the function <code>liquidChangeClass</code>. Next we define that function:</p>


<pre><code>
function changeClass( targetId, newClass ) {
    if (document.getElementById){
        target = document.getElementById( targetId );
        target.className = newClass;
    }
}

function liquidChangeClass() {
    changeClass("iBody","liquid");
}
</code></pre>
 <p>The specifics aren&#8217;t too important to this example but you can see the <code>liquidChangeClass</code> function which is triggered by the onclick event handler.</p>
 <p>And finally we need to trigger the <code>init</code> function when the page loads. Their are lots of ways of doing this which is probably a conversation for another time &#8211; I used a <code>schedule</code> function from <a href="http://themaninblue.com">themaninblue.com</a> which you can find below:</p>


<pre><code>
function schedule(objectID, functionCall, iteration) {
   if (iteration == null){
   iteration = 0;
   }

   if (objectID == "window") {
   var oldonload = window.onload;

   if (typeof window.onload != "function") {
   window.onload = functionCall;
   } else {
   window.onload = function() {
   oldonload();
   functionCall();
   }
   }
   } else if (document.getElementById(objectID)) {
   functionCall();
   } else if (iteration &amp;lt; 300) {
   setTimeout(function(){schedule(objectID, 
           functionCall, iteration + 1)}, 10);
   }

   return true;
}  

schedule("window", init);
</code></pre>
 <p>So their we have it, hopefully a simple enough example of how to move to unobtrusive javascript. As most of this is generic and used all the time it&#8217;s far simpler that it first appears.</p>

        How i came to love visio

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">11 Aug 2005</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m doing a lot more IA stuff of late and being in a Microsoft shop that meant getting to play with Visio. And I have to say it&#8217;s a great tool. It&#8217;s pretty simple to pick up, powerful, lots of options and customisations and even better &#8211; simple to get to grips with.</p>
 <p>Quite a bit of work I&#8217;ve been doing has been around process and specification. I&#8217;d read The Elements of User Experience a while back but have been getting more into it recently, and the visual vocabulary stuff is excellent. Have a look on <a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/">www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/</a> if your into this kind of planning. You can download Visio Shapes as well and then it&#8217;s just a matter of dragging, dropping and drawing arrows.</p>
 <p>Another good resourse has been <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com">boxesandarrows.com</a>,  a site I&#8217;ve read on occasion but found both more useful and more time to read recently. Documentation seems pretty key to getting projects working efficiently within team environments &#8211; and pictures say a thousand words (or something).</p>
