title: "Everyone is Not a Software Company"

The _Everyone is a Software Company_ meme has been around for a
[number](http://www.forbes.com/sites/techonomy/2011/11/30/now-every-company-is-a-software-company/#22c372311009)
[of](http://www.zdnet.com/article/now-that-everyone-is-a-software-company-should-they-operate-like-software-companies/)
[years](http://blogs.gartner.com/peter-sondergaard/everyone-is-a-technology-company/),
but it feels increasingly hard to get away from recently. That prompted
this post.

## But what do we mean by Software Company?

To be software company you're going to need to employee software
engineers and other professionals. Applying that logic to a large
number of companies at once, and looking at how existing
_software companies_ are setup, we find a few large problems.

## Google as an example

In my talk at Velocity, entitled [The Two Sides of Google Infrastructure
for Everyone
Else](https://speakerdeck.com/garethr/the-two-sides-to-google-infrastructure-for-everyone-else)
I argued both for and against the idea of wholesale adoption of
Google-like software and development/operations practices.
Even though they derive the lions share of revenue from advertising it's
easy to argue that Google are a software company. But what does that look like?
What makes Google a software company?

From the [Google Annual Report
2015](https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/20151231_alphabet_10K.pdf)

> 61,814 full-time employees: 23,336 in research and development,
> 19,082 in sales and marketing, 10,944 in operations, and 8,452
> in general and administrative functions

So, roughly 50% of Google is involved in building or running software.
[Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Google-Salaries-E9079.htm)
says salaries for engineers at Google average about $126,000-$162,000.

The [US Bureau of Labor Statistics says](http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm)
that in 2014 the number of computer programming jobs in the US
was 1,114,000, with median pay in 2015 of $100,690 a year. The
total number of jobs in the US is about 143 million, with the
average wages at $44,569.20 according to the [Social Security
Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/awidevelop.html).

The Google Annual Report also states:

> Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense,
> particularly for software engineers, computer
> scientists, and other technical staff

So, quick summary:

* Software engineers are expensive relative to others employees
* Demand for the best engineers means even higher wages
* Proportionally there aren't many software developers
* There isn't a large surplus of unemployed software engineers

Now the data above is mainly from US sources, although the Google data
is from an international company with offices around the world. My
experience says this is likely similar in Europe. Looking into data for
India and China would be super interesting I'd wager.

## Problems

One obvious problem is short-term supply and demand. Everyone wants
experienced software folks for their transformation effort. But the more
organisations that buy into the _everyone is a software company_ story
the greater the demand for a finite supply of people. For most
that means you'll to able to find less people that you want because of
competition and afford even less people because all that competition
pushes up salaries.

I've seen that firsthand while working for the UK Government. People
occasionally complained that Government was hampering commercial
organisations growth by employing lots of developers and operations
people in London.

You're also immediately in competition for software professionals with
existing software companies. Given the high salaries, most of
those employers already have developer friendly working environments and
established hiring practices suited to luring developers to work for
them. This sort of special case is hard for large companies without an
existing empowered developer organisation. I saw a lot of that at the
Government as well.

But the real macro problems are much more interesting. Even if you think
50% is a high mark for the ratio of software folk to others, you probably
agree you need a lot more than you have today. And those developers just
don't exist today to allow _everyone to be a software company_. Nor
would I argue is education in the near term producing enough skilled
people to fill that gap tomorrow. So, what happens?

* Does everyone sort-of become a software company but not quite?
* Do most organisations struggle to hire and maintain a software team
  and see the endeavour fail?
* Do increasing numbers of developers end up working for a small number
  of larger and larger software companies?
* Does outsourcing bounceback,  adapt and demonstrate innovation and
  transformation qualities to go along with the scale?
* Countries like India or China are able to produce enough software engineers
  at scale to allow there companies to act on everyone becoming a
  software company?
* We see clear winners and losers, ie. companies which become software
  companies and accelarate away from those that don't?

Personally I think to take advantage of the idea behind the meme we're
going to need order of magnitude more efficient approaches to software
delivery. What that looks like is the most interesting question of all.

## Caveats

The above is not a detailed analysis, and undoutedly has a few holes. It
also doesn't overly question the _advantage_ of being a software
company, or really question what we actually mean by _everyone_. But I
think the central point holds: Everyone is NOT a software company, nor
will everyone be a software company any time soon, unless we come up
with a fundamentally better approach to service delivery.
