title: "Information Security Reading List"
date: 2015-05-19

I read quite a bit (probably a book a week or so) and one of the topics
I've been reading on for a while is information security. In a recent
conversation someone asked for some book suggestions, so I thought I'd
write that up in a blog post rather than an email.

Most of this list isn't particularly technical. It's not a developers
list of software engineering tomes. If you're a developer or operator
then I'd recommend reading some of the more policy or journalistic
pieces as well for context. And if you're just interested in the topic
but nor particularly technical I'd skip the security engineering
suggestions.

Note that I make no claims about this being a particularly balanced
list, it's biased towards what I find interesting to read. Hopefully
you'll find it interesting too.


## Journalism

Understanding why Information Security is important tends to require
some context. The following books provide that, with detailed real-world
stories of criminal and government activities.

* [The Dark Net](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dark-Net-Jamie-Bartlett/dp/0434023159) - Jamie Bartlett - an excellent personal tale of
  investigating the hidden side of the internet.
* [Spam Nation](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Spam-Nation-Organized-Cybercrime-Epidemic-ebook/dp/B00L5QGBL0) - Brian Krebs - everything you wanted to know about how
  and why Spam works.
* [Countdown to Zero Day](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Countdown-Zero-Day-Stuxnet-Digital/dp/077043617X) - Kim Zetter - a detailed and fast paced
  description of the Stuxnet attack, and it's implications.
* [Future Crimes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Future-Crimes-Everything-Connected-Vulnerable/dp/0385539002) - Marc Goodman - a focus on the criminal
  possibilities of the modern internet and the internet of things.
* [Worm](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Worm-The-First-Digital-World/dp/1611855845) - Mark Bowden - similar to the excellent tale of Stuxnet
  above, this is the story of Conficker and how it was discovered


# Policy and context

These books are focused more on government policy and nation state
threats, and the debate about the rules of war and the internet.

* [Cyber War](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Threat-National-Security/dp/0061962244) - Richard Clarke - probably the best description of what
  cyber war is and isn't, and some of the geopolitical problems
  emerging.
* [Cyber War Will Not Take Place](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Will-Take-Place/dp/1849042802) - Thomas Rid - a good counter to the
  above book, with lots more detailed discussion of policy and definition.
* [Inside Cyber Warfare](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Cyber-Warfare-Mapping-Underworld/dp/1449310044) - Jeffrey Carr - really just a run through of
  current threats, especially organised crime.


# Security engineering

* [Security Engineering](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html) - Ross Anderson - highly technical and quite
  epic, but definitely the best security engineering book around.
* [Threat Modelling](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Threat-Modeling-Designing-Adam-Shostack/dp/1118809998) - Adam Shostack - details descriptions of how and
  why to conduct threat moddelling, with lots of examples.
* [Data Driven Security](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Driven-Security-Visualization-Dashboards/dp/1118793722) - Jay Jacobs and Bob Rudis - nice examples,
  including code samples, of applying data and statistics tools and
  practices to security problems.
* [Cloud Security and Privacy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cloud-Security-Privacy-Enterprise-Perspective/dp/0596802765) - Tim Mather, Subra Kumaraswamy, Shahed
  Latif - a good book to read for anyone working in AWS, Azure or similar.
  Good discussion of concerns and compliance approaches in third party
  environments.
* [The Tangled Web](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Tangled-Web-Securing-Applications/dp/1593273886) - Michal Zalewski - everything you ever wanted to
  know about the browser security model
* [Silence on the Wire](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silence-Wire-Passive-Reconnaissance-Indirect/dp/1593270461) - Michal Zalewski - described as a field guide
  to passive reconnaissance and indirect attacks. Good for starting to
  think about non-obvious security threats


# On my reading list

I've not read these books yet so can't recommend them as such, but they
both look good additions to the list above.

* [Data and Goliath](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Goliath-Bruce-Schneier/dp/0393244814) - Bruce Schneier - a look at the large scale data
collection programmes of governments and their implications for
everyone.
* [Black Code](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Black-Code-Ronald-J-Deibert/dp/0771025351) - Ronald J. Deibert - the story of the Citizen Lab
and it's front line cyber researchers
