        A Proliferation of Feed Standards
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">23 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>Google just announced <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/overview.html">GData</a>, which is apparently a:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8230;simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>It is basically an amalgamation of Atom, <span class="caps">RSS</span> and bits and pieces of Goodle juice. It piqued my interest for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
 <li>What was termed <em>Optimistic Concurrency</em></li>
  <li>A promise of <em>Authentication</em></li>
  <li><em><span class="caps">REST</span></em> based</li>
</ul>
 <p>The former relates to a simple solution to the problem of concurrent updates. Say I grab a file and make a change, but in between another individual grabs the same file, and after I submit my changes, they also try top submit changes all my changes could be lost. GData specifies a solution to this by introducing version numbers, only if the version you are modifying has the latest version number will it be accepted. The version number is simply provided in the edit <span class="caps">URI</span> in the feed. Nice.</p>
 <p>I wont ramble too much about <a href="http://www.xfront.com/REST-Web-Services.html"><span class="caps">REST</span>,</a> safe to say if you like URLs then it makes perfect sense and you can just get on with it. Lots of other posts about <a href="http://billburnham.blogs.com/burnhamsbeat/2004/12/rest_vs_soap_wh.html">why</a> if you missed the (ongoing) debate. It&#8217;s a bit like <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a> and the Semantic Web. The bariers to entry for microformats are the the same as those for building web pages.</p>
 <p>I say the promise of Authentication above because it turns out that part of the system is not in place yet. The other part of that I&#8217;m sceptical about is, from my reading, a complete reliance on Google to provide the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/protocol.html#Authentication">authentication</a>. For some applications that&#8217;s fine, for others you probably dont want Google in charge of the keys.</p>
 <p>It also has simple proscribed methods of dealing with categories and search queries, including <a href="http://opensearch.a9.com/">Opensearch</a> integration.</p>
 <p>I was thinking about playing with a <span class="caps">PHP</span> based client/server for GData, or at least having a look, but I think I&#8217;ll wait until I know more about the authentication side.</p>
 <p>I have a feeling Microsoft will do something like this as well, take existing open standards and republish them with a few bells and whistles. And again the developers, ie. us, are left supporting multiple slight variations on a theme. Maybe I&#8217;m just suspicious. Time will tell.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve become something of a <a href="http://mail.google.com">Gmail</a> convert over the last good few months. Moving everything online has made my life oh so much easier. I&#8217;d done the same with my feed collection a good while back with <a href="http://newsgator.co.uk">Newsgator</a>. Storing all my calendar related info was something that was on my perenial todo list. Well, Google finally got round to releasing their own <a href="http://calendar.google.com">calendar</a> after months of &#8220;will they get on with it already&#8221;. First impressions are pretty good. It&#8217;s simple. It&#8217;s obvious (at least for a geek like me) and using Gmail already I quite like the styling.</p>
 <p>One of the features I really like, but which will only mature with age, is the shared calendars. It makes publishing your itinerary to the entire world very easy. The more people use it the more useful it gets.</p>
 <p>As a case in point I decided to enter the shedule for the upcoming <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2006">@media</a> conference and share the calendar &#8211; to be honest to see how it all worked. Of course, about 24 hours after I did this the lovely folks at <a href="http://vivabit.com">Vivabit</a> completely revised the initial schedule. Ok, so I was only momentarily annoyed considering the conference just got a whole lot better &#8211; though they did drop the CSS3 discussion panel which I though would have been interesting.</p>
 <p>A little rejigging and the shared calendar is up to date again:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">iCal</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/rp1ahkacn9nkhuqnjtihno34mg@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic"><span class="caps">XML</span></a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Feel free to subscibe, either via your own Google calendar or any iCal compatible application.</p>

        Along comes a reboot
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>Well, it&#8217;s nearly 6 months since I launched the new design on here and entered into the <a href="http://fall2005.cssreboot.com/">2005 Fall reboot</a> with minimal acclaim but lots of nice comments and some traffic. That means it&#8217;s nearly time for the Spring event! I still like this design, which is something of a first for a pet project, so made a descision early to do something different.</p>
 <p>I like the reboot. It&#8217;s a deadline for a start, with all the good and bad things that that entails. And as I&#8217;ve mentioned to a few people recently the 6 month release schedule seems just about right.</p>
 <p>My new pet project aims to fill a gap that I&#8217;ve noticed when scouring the web for knowledge. I&#8217;ve mentioned before on here about being a fan of books, and have something of a stash of web, design and software related titles that I plough through pretty much constantly. But knowing what to buy, and what to read next, is never easy &#8211; even when I consider myself in the know. I&#8217;ve still got a fair few titles from when I started out which, in hindsight, were not the best starting point for a budding web designer.</p>
 <p>So along comes <a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com">Webdesignbookshelf.com</a></p>
 <p><a href="http://webdesignbookshelf.com"><img src="http://morethanseven.net/images/2.png" alt="Webdesignbookshelf.com" /></a></p>
 <p>The domain is sorted. The design is nearly sorted (but subject to change a bit). The backend I did a while back (more on some of that later). I&#8217;ve no idea what happens to it in IE yet, but you cant have everything. One think I do need to sort however is content.</p>
 <p>What I&#8217;m aiming for is good quality reviews. For the start I&#8217;m not looking to have a percentage score, or a star rating system, or similar. In my experience these tend to cheapen the end result, and become the be all and end all of the review. Books deserve more. Alot of it depends on context as well. The recent <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/jsant1/">Javascript Anthology</a> is a good book and worth the admission price, but I skipped most of it as it covered things from quite a basic point of view to begin with, something I wasn&#8217;t expecting. It really kicked into action later on, especially the accessibility chapter and the section on obect orientation. I would have liked to know all that before I bought it.</p>
 <p>With so much <a href="http://alistapart.com">information</a> <a href="http://digital-web.com">available</a> <a href="http://evolt.org">online</a>, and <a href="http://bitesizestandards.com/">new sites</a> popping up all the time, I still think books have a place. Especially with lots of talk of <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">self publishing</a> at the moment maybe we&#8217;ll see more books bypassing the old publishing processes. This could include books bypassing any kind of editorial process as well, good quality reviews can help act as a filter, a helping hand if you will.</p>
 <p>Anyway, if anyone reading this far fancies contributing a review or two please let me know. I cant promise wealth, or fame and fortune just yet. But you should get a warm feeling that your helping a community, and you name up in lights if you like that sort of thing. And watch out for the May 1st launch over at the <a href="http://cssreboot.com">reboot</a>, should be another good one.</p>

        Where to put all that data? S3 resources
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>Lets face it, web apps are getting bigger. At least in terms of the amount of data they store. Take two big poster siblings, <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. All those user accounts, all that interlinking between then, all that meta data. <a href="http://technorati.com">Technorati</a> is another example &#8211; trying to keep up with all blogs everywhere in as near to real time as possible has got to be seriously data intensive. And at times this has shown through, all have had <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/12/continued_hiccu.html">problems</a>  at <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/blogspotting/archives/2005/07/why_technorati.html">some</a> <a href="http://ishavingamassage.com/">point</a> in their short histories.</p>
 <p>If you are looking to get into the world of big, community focused, web apps then you need space. And I know I cant afford a huge outlay on storage and bandwidth, even most small web shops would probably have something of a problem with the large outlay, limited short term money making problem.</p>
 <p>An interesting solution to this would appear to exist in the shape of <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">S3</a> from <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>. It has been around a little time, and <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1102/">others</a> have been intrigued enough to mention it, but I decided not to ramble on until I&#8217;d had a brief play. Well, it&#8217;s quite cool.</p>
 <p>Amazon themselves provide a number of <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=47">useful code examples</a><br />
in different languages, including Perl, Python, C#, Java, Ruby and <span class="caps">PHP</span>. They also provide examples of the raw <span class="caps">HTTP</span> requests for thos that way inclined.</p>
 <p>This openness (OK, so they dont really have a choicee, the whole product consists of an open <span class="caps">API</span>, it being closed would seem to limit it&#8217;s usage!), as always, has allowed the community to run with the idea, building up sample apps and some easy to use wrappers:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://townx.org/blog/elliot/s3_rails">Rails example</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://caffo.backpackit.com/pub/502395">Another Rails example</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.other10percent.com/?p=15">BitBucket for Python</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.neurofuzzy.net/2006/03/17/amazon-s3-php-class/"><span class="caps">PHP</span> 4 class</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.apokalyptik.com/?p=12"><span class="caps">PHP</span> 5 example</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Amazon-S3/">Perl <span class="caps">CPAN</span> module</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.carion.org/s3dav/index.html">Java based webDAV server</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Nothing here feels complete as yet. Most are early hacks by people getting on board early and giving the rest of us a starting point.</p>
 <p>Overall I like things like S3. If it works reliably and scales well then it could become something that just sits behind all sorts of <a href="http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2006/03/firefox_s3_some.html">realy</a> <a href="http://www.holovaty.com/blog/archive/2006/04/07/0927">cool</a> <a href="http://jkeyes.com/2006/03/ten_ideas_for_amazon_s3_applic.php">ideas</a>, preventing data loss and removing another potential headache for the small developer.</p>
 <p>Any other resources, or ideas, more than welcome.</p>

    <span class="post-date">07 Apr 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been going along to the local industry do <a href="http://thinkandadrink.com">Think and a Drink</a> for a good long while now and they have talked me into speaking at the next do. So I wont be thinking for the first hour, rather rambling on about the chosen topic of Web 2.0. My loose plan is to mock the term and big up the technology involved. Someone else has the job of looking at the business implications, which should also be pretty interesting.</p>
 <p>Apparently this is me:</p>
 <p>Gareth works at TH_NK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a newcastle based brand technology company. He is involved in a number of areas of the web design and development process, from the design of modern web applications to building effective online interfaces. In his spare time, he blogs on web design, development and accessibility at <a href="http://morethanseven.net">morethanseven.net</a> and organises events for the local developer community on <a href="http://newcastlenewmedia.org">newcastlenewmedia.org</a>. Keeping up-to-speed with web trends and new technology is something Gareth is passionate about Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and it shows.</p>
 <p>If anyone who has never been before, or isn&#8217;t a <a href="http://codeworks.net">codeworks</a> member, wants to go along then let me know. I&#8217;m sure Heather would love more people along, and be good to see some familiar faces (or at least familiar domain names) in the audience.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ll publish my brief presentation if it&#8217;s any good after the event. See you there?</p>
