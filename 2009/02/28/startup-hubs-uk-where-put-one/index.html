  <h1 class="post-title">Startup Hubs in the UK - Where To Put One?</h1>
  <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2009</span>
  <p>I always enjoy reading things by <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, even if I&#8217;d like to be able to disagree with his conclusions on occasion. It&#8217;s not just that I love <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">Hackers and Painters</a>, but also he often says things like the following that make me smile:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hackers are much more constrained by gentlemen&#8217;s agreements than regulations. If they shake your hand on a promise, they&#8217;ll keep it. But show them a lock and their first thought is how to pick it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His latest short essay concerns <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/maybe.html">startup hubs</a> again, something that I&#8217;m actually pretty interested in, end up talking to <a href="http://imranali.name/">people</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/herbkim">about</a>, but hardly ever writing anything on. Mike over at Techcrunch Uk elicited some good comments last year with a <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/07/29/starting-the-campaign-for-the-techhub/">post on the subject</a>. As usual Graham focuses on the US, but what about translating his idea of buying a Startup Hub and applying it to the UK? He sets several criteria for success:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have good weather?</li>
	<li>Do people live downtown, or have they abandoned the center for the suburbs?</li>
	<li>Would the city be described as &#8220;hip&#8221; and &#8220;tolerant,&#8221; or as reflecting &#8220;traditional values?&#8221;</li>
	<li>Are there good universities nearby? Are there walkable neighborhoods?</li>
	<li>Would nerds feel at home?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets assume for the moment that the idea would work. Take £15-20million and invest in 30 or so well chosen startups on the condition they move into town. The question is then: <strong>where in the UK would this be most likely to work? And are their any UK specific criteria that would increase the success rate?</strong></p>
<p>Some people might be thinking &#8220;but no UK city is going to invest £20million in a scheme to encourage startups&#8221;. Leeds is <a href="http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/business-news/Universities-bid-to-help-.4979184.jp">doing just that</a>. Or rather Yorkshire Forward are putting up £35million along with Leeds University putting up £31milion. What are they doing with all that money? They are going to build a big building with it &#8211; which is exactly what Graham says won&#8217;t work.</p>
