  <h1 class="post-title">Example of using XMPP on App Engine (via IMified)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">21 Feb 2009</span>
  <p>As I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/02/07/xmpp-and-offline-processing-coming-google-app-engi/">mentioned before</a>, App Engine is getting an <span class="caps">XMPP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> at some point soon. But if you just can&#8217;t wait to start adding IM interfaces to your applications then you <em>can</em> do it now, by using a nifty third party in <a href="http://imified.com/">IMified</a>.</p>
<p>IMified provide an incredibly simple <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">API</span> for interacting with your own IM bot. If we want to be buzz word compliant we might even call it a <a href="http://webhooks.pbwiki.com">webhook</a>. It&#8217;s also currently a free service while they work through the beta. The <a href="http://new.imified.com/developers/api">documentation</a> is short and to the point but only contains examples in <span class="caps">PHP</span>. It supports multiple step <em>conversations</em> as well as authentication.</p>
<p>So, armed with a little time on the train over the last few days I got to work knocking together a quick demo application as a proof of concept. You can find the site on <a href="http://imified-demo.appspot.com/">imified-demo.appspot.com</a> and if you want to chat with the bot you can add <em>appengineimified@bot.im</em> to your contacts. The bot uses the Jabber protocol so is available over Jabber or GTalk. IMified make it easy to use <span class="caps">MSN</span> or Yahoo IM accounts as well, which is something the App Engine <span class="caps">API</span> might very well not do I would imagine.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjRDww" alt="Screengrab of the IMified App Engine site"/></p>
<p>As always you can find the code on <a href="http://github.com/garethr/appengine-imified/tree/master">GitHub</a>. Most of the code is actually just the site itself or settings to make local development easier. The following is a slightly edited version of the live code (logging and caching removed to make it easier to follow). All we need to do is accept a <span class="caps">HTTP</span> Post request with a list of arguments and return a plain text response. All being well the response is sent as a IM message to the sender.</p>
<pre>class IMified(webapp.RequestHandler):
    "This is the endpoint for the message from IMified"
    def post(self):
        "We recieve post data from IMified"
        userkey = self.request.get('userkey')
        network = self.request.get('network')
        msg = self.request.get('msg')
        step = self.request.get('step')
        try:
            # we try and create the message
            message = Message(
                userkey = userkey,
                network = network,
                msg = msg,
                step = int(step)
            )   
            message.put()
            # the response is send as an IM message to the sender
            self.response.out.write('Message saved')
        except:
            self.response.out.write('An error ocured, message not saved')</pre>
<p>IMified can obviously be used outside App Engine as well, and in fact it&#8217;s not just about working around limitations in existing systems. Running the long running processes required for bots, and potentially even running your own <span class="caps">XMPP</span> server, is fiddly at times and requires at least some setup, monitoring and configuration to get working. Not having that as a barrier for entry for simple experiments or applications is a good thing.</p>
<p><a href="http://aralbalkan.com/">Aral</a> spoke at the last <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/django-london"><span class="caps">DJUGL</span></a> about App Engine and mentioned a wide range of third party services that you can use to get around current limitations. IMified definitely fits into this group of support services very nicely indeed. I&#8217;d love to see them do really well as it really makes it much easier to get started with <span class="caps">XMPP</span> applications, even if what you can do is limited to a few simple APIs. I&#8217;d love to hear about other services that people are using in this way to build these distributed applications.</p>
