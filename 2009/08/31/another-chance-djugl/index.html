  <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2009</span>
  <p><a href="http://djugl.eventwax.com/djugllondon-python"><span class="caps">DJUGL</span></a> is back, the <em>monthly</em> Django meetup in London. I think the last few times have been as much about useful Python stuff as just using Django, and this time it&#8217;s officially a bit more broad ranging. If you&#8217;re in or around London on the 24th September then come along.</p>
<p>You can get more information on <a href="http://twitter.com/londonpython">Twitter</a> or by following <a href="http://twitter.com/robertlofthouse/">Rob</a>. But expect a few short talks, some interesting conversations and maybe some beer with other like minded developers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be talking about automating deployment of Python web applications. If you follow me on Twitter you&#8217;ll have heard me rambling a little about some of what I&#8217;ve been up to, and some of the posts here give an insight into what I&#8217;ve been working on. But the short version is that several friends mentioned how difficult it could be to get a working Django application from a local machine to a production web server. And I though I better get down in script form my experiences of Django, <span class="caps">WSGI</span> applications and web server setup to make things easier.</p>
<p>I think this situation is partially caused by the success of the Django development server, and partially by people coming from a <span class="caps">PHP</span> background. In my <span class="caps">PHP</span> days I think I always wanted to know how Apache did it&#8217;s think, so long ago jumped into anything and everything in httpd.conf from loading modules to virtual hosts. But not everyone does the same, and <span class="caps">PHP</span> does make simple deployments easy enough that you might get away without doing so. Rails went through the same problems and seems to be coming out the other side. I&#8217;m hoping that Django and Python is soon to be in the same position, where basic deployment is just a given.</p>
