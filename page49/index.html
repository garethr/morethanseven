        Getting going with Symfony
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Sep 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve tinkered with a rather large number of these web application frameworks, in Ruby, Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span> and C#, at some point over the last few years. But I&#8217;ve never really settled on any of them &#8211; mainly because my day job didn&#8217;t need me to and also because I like playing with new toys. I even tinkered with <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/webphp/">my own homage</a> to <a href="http://webpy.org/">Web.py</a> in <span class="caps">PHP</span> which a few people have picked and are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wephp/">running with</a>.</p>
<p>Right now though I&#8217;ve been doing some work with a <a href="http://rbd.shiftnetwork.co.uk/">few</a> <a href="http://www.bofh.org.uk/">people</a> on a Rails project. Their are some seriously nice things in Rails that I don&#8217;t see elsewhere; really good testing support baked in for one, and some serious deplyments for another.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/">Symfony</a> is another <span class="caps">PHP</span> framework but one that only supports PHP5 (a good thing in my book). It&#8217;s basically a slick integration of lots of existing mature <span class="caps">PHP</span> tools plus some good old <span class="caps">MVC</span> and tried and trusted Software Patterns. I also discovered from a few YAHOO&#8217;s that they have started using it on some levels within <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>.</p>
<p>My interest piqued I found a couple of <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fullo/federico-feroldi-php-in-yahoo/">related</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dustin.whittle/symfony-yui-professional-web-20">presentations</a> on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> (my new favourite web app), and the site has a <a href="http://www.symfony-project.com/book/1_0">high quality online documentation</a> which can also be <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Definitive-Guide-Symfony-Experts-Source/dp/1590597869">purchased in dead tree format</a>.</p>
<p>Having a play around with Symfony it took me a little while to get everything up and running, but I&#8217;d kept some handy notes for later. Hopefully they might be useful to someone other than me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve dropped in a few variables denoted by braces where relevant. The paths are from my <span class="caps">MAMP</span> and <span class="caps">PEAR</span> based environment and I&#8217;m using a MySQL database, though you could just as easily use Sqlite.</p>
<p>First we set up a virtual host in Apache. You have to do this manually at the moment. I already have a script for setting up virtual hosts under apache on OS X which I might extend to do this for me if I end up using Symfony alot.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1&gt;
  ServerName 
  DocumentRoot "/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/{project}/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  Alias /sf /Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf
  &lt;Directory "/Applications/MAMP/bin/php5/lib/php/data/symfony/web/sf"&gt;
    AllowOverride All 
    Allow from All</p>
</Directory>
&lt;Directory &#8220;/Applications/<span class="caps">MAMP</span>/htdocs/{project}/web&#8221;&gt;
AllowOverride All
Allow from All
</Directory>
<p></VirtualHost></pre></code></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;cd /www
mkdir {project}
cd {project}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Now we dive into the actual symfony commands. We&#8217;ll just setting up both a frontend and a backend for this app which I think is likely to be pretty typical. I quite like the idea of seperate entities for these.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-project {project_name}
symfony init-app frontend
symfony init-module frontend {module_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>Next we have to configure our database connection by editing /config/databases.yml</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;all:
    propel:
      class: sfPropelDatabase
      param:
        dsn: mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>That done we can set up our data definitions in <em>/config/schema.yml</em>. Read the documention for all the details but you can probably get the general idea.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel:
 item:
   id:
   title: varchar(200)
   description: longvarchar
   created_at:&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>And yet another quick change in <em>/config/propel.ini</em></p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;propel.database.createUrl = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306
propel.database.url = mysql://{username}:{password}@localhost:3306/{database_name}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>The next set of commands build our model files, create <span class="caps">SQL</span> for out chosen database and then create the tables in the database.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony propel-build-model
symfony propel-build-sql
symfony propel-insert-sql&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll quickly create a backend using the scaffolding. Note that <em>item</em> here is the model name which is taken from the <em>schema.yml</em> config file above.</p>
<p><code>&lt;pre&gt;symfony init-app backend
symfony propel-generate-crud backend items Item&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
<p>All in all not bad going. And that&#8217;s basically the same for most of the apps you&#8217;re likely to develop. It could probably be a little easier in the database and apache config areas in fairness. Rails&#8217; use of an inbuild webserver really helps here. But the use of <span class="caps">YAML</span> to define the model is, in my mind, more straightforward that using Ruby in Rails migrations. I&#8217;ve an app in the works at the moment and I&#8217;m looking at using Symfony. If that pans out I&#8217;ll blog more about the bits I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; the inbuilt unit testing framework high on my list.</p>

        Brighton Rock(s)

    <span class="post-date">10 Sep 2007</span>

    <p>Back from a madcap weekend in Brighton for the <a href="http://2007.dconstruct.org/">dconstruct</a> BarCamp Brighton double header. If I was to write down everything I can remember we&#8217;d be here for a week. If I was to write down simply everything then we&#8217;d be here longer still. Information packed just doesn&#8217;t cover it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll likely sort some more detailed posts on some particular topics that piquet my interest in the coming weeks or months, for instance user centred design vs agile methodologies (thanks to <a href="http://www.disambiguity.com/">Leisa Reichelt</a>), some more rambling posts on web application frameworks, microformats for write APIs, OAuth and countless other things I&#8217;ve no doubt forgotten.</p>
<p>One thing you can get now is my BarCamp presention which I&#8217;ve uploaded to <a href="http://slideshare.net">SlideShare</a>. I&#8217;ve not used this much previously but I&#8217;m smitten and will be uploading a few other past presentions in the next few weeks as soon as I can find them. If you&#8217;re interested in RESTful architectures or Rabbits then this might float your boat:</p>
<p><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" width="425" height="348"><param name="movie" value="http://s3.amazonaws.com/slideshare/ssplayer.swf?id=106632&doc=restful-rabbits310" /></object></p>
<p>I also took lots of photos (some with <a href="http://cackhanded.net">Norm&#8217;s</a> very nice 1.4f 50mm lens, thanks Norm) whick I&#8217;ll get on <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> when I get a moment. Expect lots of portraits of people (maybe including you?) for once instead of odd abstract architecture and textures.</p>
<p>Final thing I&#8217;ll say for now is a big thankyou to anyone or everyone who sorted all this out. The 600-700 geeks descending on brighton all got fed, watered/beered and educated without anything appearing to go wrong (except when the hotel bar ran out of beer &#8211; I blame <a href="http://nascentguruism.com/">Steve Marshall</a>). I&#8217;m looking at you <a href="http://clearleft.com">clearlefties</a> and <a href="http://www.glennjones.net/Home/">Glenn</a> and everyone from Madgex. Good job everyone involved.</p>

    <p>More interesting Newcastle centric news, although this time partly releveant to everyone else &#8211; well, as long as you live in Oxford, Brighton, Leeds or Manchester that this.</p>
<p><a href="http://notes.natbat.net/">Natalie Downe</a> has spent some of her copious spare time (having left the agency way of life and gone all <a href="http://notes.natbat.net/2007/08/19/freelance/">freelance</a> too) cooking up <a href="http://geekvenues.com/">Geekvenues</a>. It&#8217;s an attempt to map (using Google Maps) any and all geek related venues around the UK. Local meetup places perhaps, regular venues, or just geek friendly pubs with wifi.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been adding some venues for Newcastle and they can be found over at <a href="http://newcastle.geekvenues.com/">newcastle.geekvenues.com/</a>. If anyone knows of any other ones let me know. And if anyone is thinking &#8220;I want it to cover my neck of the woods&#8221; then get in touch with Nat, ideally with a link to a <span class="caps">KML</span> file of locations. I&#8217;m looking at <a href="http://www.azcazandco.com">Alan</a> and <a href="http://sneeu.com/blog/">John</a> from Edinburgh in particular here.</p>

    <p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOpenCoffee.png" title="Open Coffee" alt="Open Coffee" /></p>
<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is a new, open, informal and regular meetup for technology entrepreneurs, designers, bloggers, developers, geeks, investors and anyone else whoâ€™s interested.</p>
<p>We are going to meet every Thursday morning, between 10am and 12pm, at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=the+side+cafe+newcastle">The Side</a> just off Newcaste Quayside.</p>
<p>The first event will be held on September 13th. So come and share ideas, demo, get to know each other or just have a coffee.</p>
<p>OpenCoffee Newcastle is part of the global community effort over at <a href="http://www.opencoffeeclub.org">opencoffeeclub.org</a>. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html">the blog post that started it all</a></p>
<p>With all that out of the way a little bit of background and some geekier links. I&#8217;d been meaning to get an OpenCoffee event up and running for a while and after a couple of chats in nice pubs with <a href="http://sam.aaron.name/">Sam</a> and a trip to The Side we had a date and a vague plan. Worst case is it&#8217;s me and Sam just meeting up but hopefully a few more people will make it along. We should have wireless as well for any demos.</p>
<p>Note I&#8217;ll likely be somewhat wired. I might be up in edinburgh the night before for <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/"><span class="caps">FOWA</span> roadtrip</a> and in any case I&#8217;ll have been up all night at <a href="http://www.barcampbrighton.org/">barcampbrighton</a>.</p>
<p>You can register for the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/254890/">event on upcoming</a> or even register for <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3537/">the group</a>. Or you could just turn up. See you there! Any questions post a comment (either here on on upcoming) or drop me an email.</p>

        HTML. An alternative to Word?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 Aug 2007</span>

    <p>When I&#8217;m writing code, be it <span class="caps">CSS</span>, Javascript, Ruby, whatever, I don&#8217;t like big bulky IDE&#8217;s. Give me <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or Vim any day. Going all freelance I now have the occasional need to produce nice documents and being in charge means I get to decide what I use to produce them. I never really liked working in Microsoft Word so decided against it. But rather than sensibly going for an obviously alternative I decided to just use <span class="caps">HTML</span>, or rather more specifically, <a href="http://textism.com/tools/textile/">Textile</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgOnlineDocs.png" title="An example of a current document" alt="An example of a current document" /></p>
<p>As an old time <a href="http://textpattern.com">textpattern</a> I learned to love the simple text transformation language and it&#8217;s inclusion in the <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> apps made me smile and more likely to use them. Why use it over <span class="caps">HTML</span> you may ask? For me I think about <span class="caps">HTML</span> like a browser, as a tree of nodes. I end up spending quite a bit of time writing content then going backwards and wrapping what I just wrote in markup. This is fine for your typical site, but for writing documents it&#8217;s hard to get into a flow. With textile I can flow in one direction.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;m liking it alot. I can seperate content from presentation (Word styles are a myth), easily repurpose my content (text, html, pdf) and write documents in anything I like, including Word if I chose to.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a pretty good excuse to play with various bits of CSS3, including multi-columns, advanced layout, generated content and the various print offerings. Given I can control the rendering engine then produce a <span class="caps">PDF</span> to distribute I can use anything that the latest browser builds can deal with.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not got all the workflow steps automated yet, I&#8217;m using Firefox to print documents to <span class="caps">PDF</span> (via Preview) at the moment which works fine but is still a manual process I can get rid of using something like <a href="http://www.re.be/css2xslfo/">css2xslfo</a> and <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">fop</a>. I&#8217;m also pretty sure the PDFs won&#8217;t be accessible, although the original markup certainly should be.</p>
<p>As I produce more complex documents I&#8217;ll likely miss things like automated table of contents generation, footnotes and page numbering but, then again, I can write that in Javascript (or on the server) if I so choose. I was impressed listening to HÃ¥kon Wium Lie at <a href="http://vivabit.com/atmedia2007/">@media</a> about the process they used to format his last book using <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. I&#8217;m half tempted to spend time rolling all this together into a web app. It would be pretty good fun really; APIs, <span class="caps">XSLT</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, <span class="caps">PDF</span>, some nice UI problems, etc. Only problem I see would be entering a market contested by Microsoft, Google, Sun and er, lots of others.</p>
