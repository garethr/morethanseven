        Semantic Web acronym links primer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>One thing you hit pretty rapidly when you start having a look into all this Semantic Web malarkey is the number of rather <em>silly</em> acronyms and abbreviations. In fairness it&#8217;s true of pretty much every technical or academic discipline I&#8217;ve come across and you can ask the people I work with what I think about that &#8211; I wont ramble on here.</p>
<p>And dont think this is all because I&#8217;m not technical enough for ya, I have code on my blog and a faintly scary collection of technical tomes. I just think acronyms tend to breed elitism and make the world less penetrable, especially when they are often described in relation to other acronyms. So, after pointing out a problem here&#8217;s a stab at a solution; a web designers guide (with the relevant links) to my understanding of the different things involved. I&#8217;m not an expert on this yet mind, so if I&#8217;m wrong and someone more knowlegable can provide a better description then please comment. If the descriptions from the relevant links I have are good enough I&#8217;ll just use those as well.</p>
<p>Most people will probably have come across <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/"><span class="caps">XML</span></a> so hopefully this is an easy one. <span class="caps">XML</span> is the eXtensible Markup Language. For me that means it&#8217;s a set of rules for defining your own markup language; from simple data exchange formats to whole programming languages. The W3C says (which I think nicely highlights my problem from above)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extensible Markup Language (<span class="caps">XML</span>) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from <span class="caps">SGML</span> (<span class="caps">ISO</span> 8879)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt"><span class="caps">XSLT</span></a> is another quite common tool. The W3C again defines it in relation to another acronym but this time I dont mind as much and we&#8217;ve got a defintion of <span class="caps">XML</span> here anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<span class="caps">XSLT</span> is] a language for transforming <span class="caps">XML</span> documents into other <span class="caps">XML</span> documents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty straighforward description, the only real problem for the outsider is wondering why you would want to do that!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"><span class="caps">RDF</span></a> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/rdf/default.asp">W3Schools says</a> is really where the Semantic Web stuff starts. The W3C start off with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Resource Description Framework (<span class="caps">RDF</span>) integrates a variety of application&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah. It integrates applications&#8230; What! But wait:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <span class="caps">RDF</span> specifications provide a lightweight ontology system to support the exchange of knowledge on the Web</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty good actually, as long as you&#8217;re happy with the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29">ontology</a>. Their is a <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf1.html">good article</a> that takes a stab at the question from Tim Bray. I think, simply put, <span class="caps">RDF</span> is common set of rules for defining your own meta data (information about information) so it&#8217;s interopable with everyone else doing the same thing.</p>
<p>But how are we going to get all that <span class="caps">RDF</span> into our web pages (Semantic or otherwise)? <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a> is one possibility (not going there right now) which involves extending <span class="caps">HTML</span> (all varieties) with some additional attributes with the purpose of being able to embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in the document. Or from the W3C:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RDFa is a syntax that expresses this structured data using a set of elements and attributes that embed <span class="caps">RDF</span> in <span class="caps">HTML</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-grddl-20040413/"><span class="caps">GRDDL</span></a> is probably the worst offender here in terms of someone spending too much time coming up with the acronym. It stands for <em>Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages</em>. From looking it appears to be a standard way of saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here be some <span class="caps">RDF</span>. If you want the <span class="caps">RDF</span> for this document please use this <span class="caps">XSL</span> transformation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml">eRDF</a>, or embedded <span class="caps">RDF</span> is a simpler approach to RDFa which involves no additional custom attributes but does not aim to be able to represent all the possible <span class="caps">RDF</span> constructs.</p>
<p>Of course their are many more, but at least that&#8217;s a start. Let me know what you think.</p>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>After the numerous games of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(game) ">Werewolf</a> at <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon2">Barcamp London</a> recently a few of us <a href="http://kid666.com/blog/2007/02/19/werewolf-cards/">got chatting</a> about the idea of custom Werewolf cards using <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>. Well I&#8217;ve just finished a very simple example of this and thought I&#8217;d post it up.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgFlickrwerewolf.jpg" title="Definately a Werewolf" alt="Definately a Werewolf" /></p>
<p>Head over to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf">morethanseven.net/presents/werewolf</a> for a set of printable cards based on Flickr Machine Tags.</p>
<p>In the future I may enhance this with a nifty interface which lets visitors select the number of each card they want &#8211; and I spoke briefly with <a href="http://www.whitelabel.org/">Stefan</a> from <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo</a> about if it&#8217;s possible to link into printing them on those lovely Moo cards.</p>
<p>If you want anyone to appear just add the relevant werewolf machine tag!</p>

        Parsing ERDF
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Now we&#8217;ve got some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/microformats-and-erdf-sitting-in-a-tree/">eRDF in our pages</a> we need to extract it out in preparation for doing someting with it.</p>
<h3>With <span class="caps">XSL</span></h3>
<p>First up we want to try and extract the eRDF in our page into an <span class="caps">RDF</span> document. <a href="http://iandavis.com">Ian Davis</a> has already created a nice <span class="caps">XSL</span> document to do just that. and I&#8217;ve implemented a <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/erdf/">nice service wrapper</a> to extract the <span class="caps">RDF</span> from a given <span class="caps">URL</span>. Try pointing it at <a href="http://morethanseven.net">morethanseven.net</a> or <a href="http://iandavis.com">iandavis.com</a> for an example of it in action. Next step here is to extend it to allow extracting a simple vcard from the <span class="caps">RDF</span> in a similar manner to <a href="http://suda.co.uk/">Brian Suda&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">Microformats extractor</a>.</p>
<h3>With Javascript</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.danwebb.net/">Dan Webb</a> has recently written up his <a href="http://www.danwebb.net/2007/2/9/sumo-a-generic-microformats-parser-for-javascript">Sumo! microformas parser</a> and boy is it really rather fancy. At the moment he&#8217;s only got profiles for hCard, hCalendar and hResume but writing profiles is relatively simple. Accoring to one of Dans comments he&#8217;s working on adding support for rel and rev style microformats like rel-tag and <span class="caps">XFN</span>.</p>
<p>Although billed as a Microformats parser, in reality what Dan&#8217;s created is pretty generic. You can use it to parse out any information marked up with any semantic class names &#8211; just like our eRDF.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a very basic Sumo! profile for <span class="caps">FOAF</span> and some <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/foaf/">simple tests to extract eRDF data from a test page</a>. This is very much a proof of concept of extracting eRDF using Javascript but would be relatively simple to extend for the full <span class="caps">FOAF</span> spec once Dan or someone else extends Sumo! to support rel and rev.</p>
<p>On a related note the combination of Sumo! and the <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> javascript console is just perfect. Anyone who hasn&#8217;t yet downloaded the latest version should get over there quick.</p>

        Microformats and eRDF sitting in a tree

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Mar 2007</span>

    <p>Following on from <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/what-erdf-can-learn-from-microformats/">my previous post</a> on <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">eRDF</a> I&#8217;ve started to play around with it. For anyone bored enought to have read the source of this site today you&#8217;ll have seen a couple of behind the scenes changes &#8211; specifically I&#8217;ve added a dash of <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span></a>.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">FOAF</span>, or Friend of a Friend, project is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creating a Web of machine-readable pages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I sort of see it as a bigger and more complicated older brother to <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn"><span class="caps">XFN</span></a> and <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a>.</p>
<p>First things first, unlike <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats</a>, using eRDF needs a bit of setup outside just adding classes and attributes &#8211; specifically you need to add a profile to the <em>head</em> element of your document and then add some namespaces links into the <em>head</em> like so:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;head profile="http://purl.org/NET/erdf/profile"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="schema.rdfs" href="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="schema.foaf" href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Then you&#8217;re onto the more familiar ground (if you&#8217;re used to Microformats) of adding semantic attributes. I already had the following snippet markup up in hCard, i just needed to add a few more classes (-foaf-Person, foaf-weblog and foaf-name) to existing elements.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id="iHead"&gt;
  &lt;h2 class="vcard -foaf-Person" id="gareth"&gt;
  &lt;a href="/" class="url org foaf-weblog"&gt;Morethanseven&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;is where &lt;a href="mailto:&amp;#103;&amp;#097;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#064;&amp;#109;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#110;&amp;#115;&amp;#101;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;" 
    class="email fn foaf-name"&gt;Gareth Rushgrove&lt;/a&gt; plays with the web
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The full <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"><span class="caps">FOAF</span> Specification</a> details a huge range of other elements &#8211; everything from <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_Project">foaf:Project</a> for making associations between yourself and projects you have worked on, to <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/#term_OnlineGamingAccount">foaf:OnlineGamingAccount</a> which is pretty self explanatory.</p>
<p>When parsed out that gives you a foaf document a little something like:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?&gt;
&lt;rdf:RDF xmlns:admin="http://webns.net/mvcb/" 
  xmlns:doap="http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#"

  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=""&gt;
    &lt;admin:generatorAgent 
      rdf:resource="http://purl.org/NET/erdf/extract"/&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about=""/&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="#gareth"&gt;
    &lt;rdf:type rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"/&gt;
    &lt;ns_13:weblog xmlns:ns_13="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
      Morethanseven
    &lt;/ns_13:weblog&gt;
    &lt;ns_14:name xmlns:ns_14="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"&gt;
      Gareth Rushgrove
    &lt;/ns_14:name&gt;
  &lt;/rdf:Description&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="http://morethanseven.net"/&gt;
  &lt;rdf:Description rdf:about="mailto:gareth@morethanseven.net"/&gt;
&lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;</code></pre>
<p>So far I&#8217;d agree with <a href="http://ben-ward.co.uk/journal/fao-rdf/">Ben</a>. All I&#8217;ve done is something people (including me) have been doing already with hCard. But I&#8217;ve done it in a way, using eRDF, that doesn&#8217;t in any way stop me continuing using Microformats.</p>
<p>Marking things up with Microformats for it&#8217;s own sake was only ever really of interest to markup junkies (including me again). It&#8217;s only when you can parse that information out that it gets more interesting. I&#8217;ve got a follow up post to this on just that subject involving some <span class="caps">XSL</span>, Javascript, <span class="caps">PHP</span> and some standing on the shoulder of giants. It will be left to a post after that when I try do something a little different.</p>
<p>On a related note; so far I&#8217;ve found only scattered and often overly technical and verbose documentation on eRDF and <span class="caps">RDF</span> in general. I&#8217;ve been adding links to <a href="http://del.icio.us/garethr">del.icio.us</a> as I find useful resources but I can see how useful <a href="http://getsemantic.com">Get Semantic</a> has the potential to be if any of this is going to take off in the web standards community.</p>

    <span class="post-date">28 Feb 2007</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve posted a list before of events and meetups I know about around the UK but had got playing with the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/">Google Maps <span class="caps">API</span></a> and decided to go one stage further and create a hopefully useful place to put all that info in the shape of a quick mashup.</p>
<p>Have a look over on <a href="http://morethanseven.net/presents/meetup">morethanseven.net/presents/meetup</a> for a hopefully useful tool. I&#8217;ll try and keep this up to date manually for the time being, so if you know of any other get togethers please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll add them to the list. Thanks to the excellent, if a little technical (well, it is Google) <span class="caps">API</span> documentation and <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://austin.adactio.com">Adactio Austin</a> for inspiration.</p>
<p><img src="http://morethanseven.net/_assets/media/imgMapSample.jpg" title="Sample map of UK Meetups" alt="Sample map of UK Meetups" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to make this even more flexible, ideally all I should have to do is point the page at the group urls and then parse out the geo-coded microformats data and then display it on the map and page, rather than duplicate this information and maintain it by hand. So if any of the owners of these sites want to geo-code up their sites and let me know that would be great. Some <a href="http://upcoming.org">Upcoming</a> integration might be on the cards too.</p>
<p>Hopefully it should be of some use to anyone looking for things going on in their area, or if you find yourself in a strange part of the country for whatever reasons then you&#8217;ll know how to find the local geek community without risking life and limb with an odd T-Shirt.</p>
