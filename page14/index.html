        Creating A Cucumber Nagios Package With Fpm
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve written <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2011/01/16/Why-developers-should-care-about-system-packages.html">before</a> about why I like System Packages, but even I&#8217;ll admit that the barriers to creating them mean I don&#8217;t use them for everything. <a href="https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm"><span class="caps">FPM</span></a> however is making it much easier, to the point where I&#8217;m starting to create a few packages I can reuse on projects. I thought a write up of how I&#8217;m doing that for <a href="http://cucumber-nagios.org/">Cucumber-Nagios</a> might be useful.</p>
<p>For those that haven&#8217;t seen it yet, <span class="caps">FPM</span> (or Effing Package Management) is a tool that helps you build packages, like RPMs and DEBs, quickly. It can take in gems, python packages, node.js npm files or just plain directories and make files and from that create you one or more system packages. Lets have a look at a full example with a Ruby gem.I really like using cucumber-nagios, whatever platform or language I happen to be using at the time. I have a number of Django projects for instance with cucumber-nagios checks, so being able to not worry about most of the Ruby install is useful.</p>
<p>In order to use <span class="caps">FPM</span> you&#8217;ll need to install it. It&#8217;s available as a Ruby gem so lets start there. I&#8217;m not going to delve into setting up a Ruby Gems environment as it&#8217;s annoying and covered for most platforms elsehere on the internet.</p>
<pre><code>gem install fpm</code></pre>
<p>First off lets install the cucumber-nagios gem, along with all it&#8217;s dependencies, into a local folder on my build machine. This might be a virtual machine or a separate machine in your cluster. It should be running the same OS as the intended production machines however. The following examples are from Ubuntu, but it&#8217;s much the same for <span class="caps">RPM</span> based distros.</p>
<pre><code>gem install --no-ri --no-rdoc --install-dir ~/tmp/gems cucumber-nagios</code></pre>
<p>Cucumber-nagios has a large number of dependencies, so we&#8217;re going to need to create packages for all of those too. <span class="caps">FPM</span> will cleverly deal with maintaining the specified dependencies thought. We&#8217;ll use find to do this quickly, and then instruct <span class="caps">FPM</span> to convert from a gem to a deb. You could obviously do this line by line if you prefer.</p>
<pre><code>find ~/tmp/gems/cache -name '*.gem' | xargs -rn1 fpm -s gem -t deb -a all</code></pre>
<p>That should leave us with lots of new .deb files that we can have a closer look at:</p>
<pre><code>dpkg --info rubygem-cucumber-nagios_0.9.0_i686.deb
dpkg -c rubygem-cucumber-nagios_0.9.0_i686.deb</code></pre>
<p>If you already have a private apt repository set up then just upload these packages and away you go. I&#8217;d like to use apt for installing them so I can leave it to manage all the dependencies easily. If not then I&#8217;ll show you briefly how to create a local file system repo, it&#8217;s not much more work to create a shared repo available over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>.</p>
<p>First create a directory to store our packages and move our newly created .deb files into it. You&#8217;ll need to be able to execute some of these commands as root but given the topic I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;ll be able to deal with that.</p>
<pre><code>mkdir /usr/local/repo
cp *.all.deb /usr/local/repo</code></pre>
<p>For the next part you&#8217;ll need to install the dpkg development tools, and then create a file that can be read by apt when it&#8217;s looking for packages it can install.</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install dpkg-dev
dpkg-scanpackages /usr/local/repo /dev/null | gzip -9c &gt; /usr/local/repo/Packages.gz</code></pre>
<p>Now add your new package repo to your apt sources and update your package cache.</p>
<pre><code>/etc/apt/sources.list
deb file:/usr/local/repo ./
apt-get update</code></pre>
<p>At this point everything should be up and running. Let&#8217;s do a search in our repo:</p>
<pre><code>apt-cache search rubygem-
rubygem-amqp - AMQP client implementation in Ruby/EventMachine
rubygem-builder - Builders for MarkUp.
rubygem-bundler - The best way to manage your application's dependencies
rubygem-cucumber - cucumber-0.10.2

rubygem-templater - Templater has the ability to both copy files from A to B and also to render templates using ERB
rubygem-term-ansicolor - Ruby library that colors strings using ANSI escape sequences
rubygem-webrat - Ruby Acceptance Testing for Web applications</code></pre>
<p>And finally lets install cucumber-nagios from our shiny new package.</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install rubygem-cucumber-nagios</code></pre>
<p>If everything has worked out you should be able to run the cucumber-nagios-gen command to create a new project. Note that the path may be different, and in the case of debian based distros the gem bin path is not on the Path.</p>

        Devops Weekly Archive

    <span class="post-date">17 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>Since I launched it back in November my <a href="http://devopsweekly.com">Devops Weekly</a> email has been pretty well received I think. Folks on twitter seem to like it, as do a few people I&#8217;ve met at recent events who have said nice things. One thing a few people have been after though is an online archive, either because email just doesn&#8217;t work for them or more often because they missed out on the earlier issues.</p>
<p>With a little time this weekend and the help of <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> I&#8217;ve just added the seventeen iss§ues to date to the new <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/archive">Devops Weekly archive</a>. I&#8217;d have liked to do something a bit more useful, maybe introduce per link tags or a nifty search feature, but I&#8217;m pretty busy at present and reason this should serve the main purpose of getting these links online.</p>

        Vagrant At The Guardian
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>As recent blog posts on here make clear, I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a>. And when <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/">Michael</a> asked if I&#8217;d fancy talking to some of his colleagues at The Guardian about how I use it I really couldn&#8217;t say no.</p>
<p>I gave a short talk, running through the following slides, and running a few demos showing creating, destroying and provisioning new machines.</p>
<p><object id="__sse7492432" width="595" height="497"> <param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=vagrant-110402104037-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=vagrant-and-configuration-management&userName=garethr" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <embed name="__sse7492432" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=vagrant-110402104037-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=vagrant-and-configuration-management&userName=garethr" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="595" height="497"></embed> </object></p>
<p>More interesting I thought were the questions and conversations that followed. We talked a little about how Vagrant might fit into a continuous integration setup. Another aspect some of the systems folk took to was how flexible the network configuration was and whether they might be able to use this to more effectively test firewall configurations well before the final push into a production environment. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;ve been doing but it sounds feasable and useful in some organisations. If anyone is doing interesting things with Vagrants network config I&#8217;d be interested to know.</p>

        Collecting Metrics With Ganglia And Friends
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Apr 2011</span>

    <p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://cambridgegeeknights.net/">Cambridge Geek Night</a> on Monday again, the topic of conversation being using Ganglia to collect more than just base systems metrics.</p>
<p><object id="__sse7492405" width="595" height="497"> <param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=metricswithganglia-110402103441-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=metrics-with-ganglia&userName=garethr" /> <param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/> <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/> <embed name="__sse7492405" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=metricswithganglia-110402103441-phpapp01&rel=0&stripped_title=metrics-with-ganglia&userName=garethr" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="595" height="497"></embed> </object></p>
<p>The audience of web developers, the odd sysadmin and business folk seemed to enjoy it and we had lots of time for questions at the end. The main point I tried to get across was that Ganglia makes a great platform for ad-hoc metrics gathering due to the ability to just throw values at it and get time series graphs without any extra configuration.</p>
<p>The slides include a few bits of code I&#8217;ve been using that I&#8217;ll throw onto GitHub as a proper project when I get the time. These are very simple Python servers, one which allows for sending metrics information over <span class="caps">HTTP</span>, the other using <span class="caps">TCP</span> instead. Both really handy for getting more people to add hooks into applications.</p>

        Devops Isn't A Methodology
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>I was reading <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/devops-scam.html">Devops is a poorly executed scam</a> and just couldn&#8217;t resist a reply. Not because of the entertaining title, but because I both agree and disagree quite strongly with parts of the post. Read it first if you haven&#8217;t already. And yes I know I&#8217;m feeding the internet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to pick parts of the post out and then comment. Hopefully I&#8217;m not quoting these in any way out of context.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s got the potential to make a handful of people a lot of money in the same way that Agile did, but nobody is really executing on.&#8221;</h2>
<p>People are pretty aware of this fact I think, but watch what happens when people post on the mailing lists or turn up at community events with a purely marketing hat on. They just get no traction and even damage their product brand amongst the early adopters. The fact the term is starting to get used in job adverts and marketing materials isn&#8217;t really being driven by the people talking about what devops might or might not be. I think the main reason for this is that most of the people I talk to in person or online are actually pretty happy with their jobs and generally work inside companies rather than as independent consultants. They have often reached an age where they want to improve within a given field but would like a wider network than their current colleagues to discuss things with.</p>
<h2>&#8220;How do you implement Devops?&#8221;</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you do. The comparisons with Agile are interesting from a community point of view but Scrum is a methodology. To me at least devops isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just a banner or tag under which interesting conversations are happening. The argument that &#8220;You should be doing this anyway. Not earth shattering.&#8221; is a good thing. You&#8217;d be suprised by how many people don&#8217;t do all the things they should be doing, especially in small and young companies. And one of the reasons for that is no one bothered writing a list of these things down anywhere and then discussing them. I&#8217;m not saying this huge list exists or even whether it should, but the discussion is happening.</p>
<h2>&#8220;The underlying problem, however, is that dev and ops have different goals&#8221;</h2>
<p>This is spot on. I think this maybe does get missed in talk that focuses more on tools but not in the wider discussion happening about business improvements. Devops quite litterally brings those two things together. You&#8217;ll always have individual goals but where you have separate operations and development teams they should have the same fundamental goals.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Developers develop in the same environment production runs in If you deploy to Linux, you develop on Linux. No more of this coding on your Macbook Pro and deploying to Ubuntu: that is why you can&#8217;t have nice things.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Yes, yes and yes again. I&#8217;m definitely from the developer side of the tracks and I&#8217;m constantly telling people this and it&#8217;s definitely something I don&#8217;t see enough people doing. What I&#8217;d love is for all the operations people to state this to their development team and most importantly to help them set that up. Just saying <em>work like me or I won&#8217;t let you near the production machines</em> is just being obstructive. Educating and helping with tooling helps build those bridges and trust. And with trust comes the access the developers want. And less stupid bugs and less deployment issues with differing package dependencies.</p>
<h2>&#8220;None of this amounts to a methodology, as the Devops people would have you believe.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Still unsure which Devops people are saying it&#8217;s a bonefide methodology. I see the word used sometimes but generally in passing and not I don&#8217;t think meant how you mean here. And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard people speak about it in person. &#8220;Scrum methodology&#8221; returns more than 113,000 results in Google. &#8220;Devops methodology&#8221; returns about 150, some of which 404 and half of which are agregators pointing at the other half.</p>
<h2>&#8220;The Devops movement smells of a scam in the making&#8221;</h2>
<p>Some company or other is definitely going to be scammed into paying over the odds for a consultant because they used the word Devops in the sales pitch. That will have next to nothing to do with what I&#8217;d see as the Devops movement and everything to do with human nature (and sales people).</p>
