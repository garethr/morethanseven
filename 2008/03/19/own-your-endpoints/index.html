  <p>If <a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2008/02/urls-are-people-too.html">URLs are people too</a> then you better make sure you control your URLs.</p>
<p>Although some people use blog hosting services like <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> the majority of serious bloggers, web designers or companies generally use their own domain name to host their site. Controlling your own domain name is increasingly important when that <span class="caps">URL</span> is a representation of you on the internet.</p>
<p>With all these social networks we&#8217;re starting to have pieces of us scattered all over the place. I&#8217;ve joked previously about the utility of domain names over real names for interpersonal communication but this breaks down a little when not all the urls that represent me are owned by me. I control morethanseven.net/photos but I only have some influence over <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/garethr">flickr.com/photos/garethr</a>. With external hosts you also need to be aware of cybersquatting. I own morethanseven.net so no one else can use it. However with services that give you your own <span class="caps">URL</span> as part of registration everywhere people can cybersquat in hundreds of new domains that you might not even know about.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just web pages you have to worry about. Feeds are another example of URLs you just might want to keep control over. This last one is also something I see lots of people handing off to others &#8211; specifically <a href="http://feedburner.com">Feedburner</a>. Now I&#8217;m a big fan of feedburner and use it for the feeds on this site. But I don&#8217;t use the feedburner <span class="caps">URL</span>, anyone subscribing to the feeds here does so using morethanseven.net/feed/. If I decide to stop using feedburner I can, without having to upset the few people who subscribe to it by moving my feed address. It&#8217;s the same with email addresses; I love gmail but rarely actually give my gmail email address out.</p>
<p>So, start looking after your domain names a little more carefully. They are pieces of you scattered around the internet, and losing control of them is going to become increasingly socially painful.</p>
