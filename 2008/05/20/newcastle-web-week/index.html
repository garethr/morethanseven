  <h1 class="post-title">Newcastle Web Week</h1>
  <span class="post-date">20 May 2008</span>
  <p>The North East is stealing a march on London this week with all sorts going on for those who like a real world get together. Although not quite as busy as <a href="http://www.londonwebweek.co.uk/">London Web Week</a> next week we have the <a href="http://thinkingdigital.co.uk/">Thinking Digital</a> conference kicking off tomorrow, followed by a <a href="geekdinner.co.uk/">Geek Dinner</a> on Friday night and then <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampNorthEast">BarCampNorthEast</a> over the weekend. I&#8217;m even planning on popping out tonight with a few people in town for the festivities. As if fate somehow got involved the weather is also pretty darn nice today too.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t already know about these events and you&#8217;re in the area their just might still be the chance to come along. We have a few places left for barcamp in particular, you just need to <a href="http://barcampnortheast.eventwax.com/barcampnortheast/register">register over on eventwax</a>. And the Geek Dinner on friday night at The Pitcher and Piano is open to all, at least until it fills up.</p>
<p>It really is great to see thing happening at this end of the country, and a real shame I&#8217;m leaving the area so soon afterwards. I really hope the local community gets behind all these events and they act as a catalyst for interesting things. I&#8217;ve always been of the mind that if you can get enough smart, interested people together in one place then good things will happen. It&#8217;s why I enjoy going along to conferences, hackdays and barcamps. It&#8217;s also one of the main reasons I joined GCap.</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;ve recovered from the next two weeks (which may take a while as next week I&#8217;m in London for <a href="http://www.vivabit.com/atmedia2008/london/">@media</a>, <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon4">BarCampLondon4</a> and anything else I can get along to) I&#8217;ll hopefully write more about trying to organise a barcamp and, if I really get time to think, about knowledge workers outside and inside London.</p>
<p>But in the meantime leave a comment if you&#8217;re going to be around in Newcastle over the next week. It should be a great opportunity to meet new and old friends alike.</p>
