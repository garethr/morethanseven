  <span class="post-date">21 Jun 2008</span>
  <p>I&#8217;ve not written anything here for a good few weeks, my tweeting has slowed down some and I&#8217;m behind on my feed reading. I&#8217;m going to blame the new job and the daily commute from Cambridge to London I think. I&#8217;ve definitely not been any less busy that usual:</p>
<h3>Hacking</h3>
<p>We had an internal hackday on Thursday and Friday last week where lots of us over at GCap/Global downed tools and build cools stuff for a couple of days. This is exactly the sort of reason I took the job in London &#8211; for the opportunity to build interesting things quickly with other smart people. I got to play around with an event driven, music orientated, <span class="caps">API</span> hack and a more useful but less sexy documentation hack. Yes, I said documentation hack. I might be able to release the latter all being well but I need to finish it off first and kick the tyres on some internal projects</p>
<h3>Django</h3>
<p>As a development team we&#8217;re using <a href="http://djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for everything which is proving to be huge fun. It&#8217;s a decent size project and we&#8217;re pushing Django (and in particular new-forms admin) in interesting ways. Having worked previously with <span class="caps">PHP</span>, <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> and Rails I&#8217;m loving lots of bits of Django. I mentioned the <a href="http://morethanseven.net/posts/why-the-webstandards-world-appears-to-be-choosing-django/">template system</a> before but their are lots of other things to appreciate. Some of this just comes from working with people like <a href="http://simonwillison.com">Simon</a> and <a href="http://www.siudesign.co.uk/">Rob</a> who know Django pretty well. Some of it just from being able to write Python every day.</p>
<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>When not working on Django, or writing <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> or Javascipt (now mainly using <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>), I&#8217;ve been busy pushing the benefits of Continuous Integration. As someone who is actually pretty bad at writing unit tests I like the process of working with <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">Cruise Control</a> as a gatekeeper. I also like automation in general so have been busy with Ant scripts and some Twill scripts as well for more functional testing. Django&#8217;s test suite is pretty nifty and easy to use. <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/testing/">The official documentation</a> is a pretty good starting point but I&#8217;m still on the lookout for some more in depth best practices articles.</p>
<p>So, between writing lots of code I&#8217;ve had less time to write words other than internal documentation. I&#8217;m finding the change pretty refreshing at the moment but want to keep up with writing every now and again. Who knows how that will work out? I have a feeling that I might blog more geeky code related stuff but time will see how that plays out.</p>
