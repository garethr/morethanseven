      <a href="/2015/08/21/operating-unikernel-challenges/">
        A Discussion of The Operational Challenges With Unikernels
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Aug 2015</span>

    <h2>What are Unikernels</h2>

<p>Most of this post assumes a basic understanding of what unikernels are
so I’d recommend reading <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">Unikernels – the rise of the virtual library
operating system</a> before moving
on.</p>

<h2>Why are Unikernels interesting</h2>

<p>As a starting point: complexity. Managing infrastructure, and the
software that runs on it, is too complicated. You can impose
organisational rules to control this complexity (we only deploy on
Debian, we only run JVM applications, the only allowed database is
MySQL) but that limits you in other ways too, and in reality is nearly
always broken somewhere in any non-trivial environment (this appliance
uses Ubuntu, this software is only certified on Windows, PostgreSQL
doesn’t run on the JVM). So you turn to software to manage that
complexity; Puppet or Chef do a great job of allowing configuration
complexity to be managed in code (where you can test it) and Docker
allows for bundles of complexity to be isolated from other bundles of
complexity. But there are still an awful lot of moving parts.</p>

<p>Another reason is the growing realisation that security is important.
Securing systems on the internet is hard. Even though the basics are
broadly understood they are often not implemented, and the people
attempting to compromise systems are smart, well paid and highly
incentivised (basically like you). It’s generally easier to break
something than to build it. Part of this is a numbers game – to run a
reasonable sixed system you might need to run 50 different services, and
install 200 packages on every host. An attacker has to compromise just
one of those to win.</p>

<p>A further reason, if one were needed, is the proliferation of many small
internet connected devices, aka. The Internet of Things. Part of this
relates to the above points about security concerns, but some of it is
simply a matter of managing that many single purpose, low power,
devices. The overhead of a typical general purpose operating system and
application runtime just don’t fit this model.</p>

<p>Enter unikernels. Unikernels actually remove unneeded complexity. You’re
running a hypervisor and the unikernel and that’s it. The unikernel
contains only those libraries that you have specifically required. That
drastically reduces the surface area for attack as well as meaning
you’re running less software, hopefully enough less that your power
needs are reduced too. By specifically requiring individual libraries
you’re also making complexity visible. Rather than using a general
purpose operating system with it’s 100s of packages and millions of
lines of code you are at least choosing what to include.</p>

<h2>Operational challenges</h2>

<p>While I think some part of the future looks like unikernels their are
some large operational challenges to overcome before they break out of
very specific niches or research projects. Note that</p>

<p>there are architectural and software development challenges as well, I
just happen to think they’re easier to deal with.</p>

<h3>Development environment</h3>

<p>There are a few properties of a development environment that I think are
essential to modern development; development/production parity being one
of the most important. Tools like Vagrant, and a move towards
infrastructure as code, and more recently Docker have made great strides
here in the past several years. The different unikernel implementations
are generally based on lesser known software stacks (Haskell, OCaml,
Erlang, etc) so some of this is familiarity. But what does
development/production partity mean for a unikernel based system? We’re
not just talking about the individual unikernel here either – how do I
deploy unikernels? How do I compose several unikernels together to build
an application? What does a Continuous integration or deployment
pipeline look like? In my view the unikernel movement should focus some
efforts here. Not only will this make it easier for people to get
started, but having strong opinions early will allow the nascent
community to solve the problem together, rather than everyone solving it
just-in-time for themselves.</p>

<h3>Managing the hypervisor</h3>

<p>I’d argue today most developers don’t spent much time directly working
with hypervisors. Either you’re running on an in-house VMware, KVM or
Xen install with some (hopefully self-service, automated) provisioning
mechanism in place or you’re using a public cloud like AWS, Azure, etc.
The current generation of unikernel systems mainly target Xen. I think
in the short term at least this means getting to know the hypervisor.
Xen is solid software, but I don’t see a great deal of automation around
it – say well maintained Puppet modules, API clients or a Terraform
provider. In the long term we’ll hopefully have higher level interfaces,
but in the short term efforts here would lower the barrier to entry
considerably.</p>

<h4>Double down on AWS</h4>

<p>Given the above, and given the ubiquity of EC2 (which is based on Xen)
it might be wise to build up first-class tools around using EC2 as a
target environment for unikernel deployments. EC2 supports custom
kernels, but these require a number of convoluted steps that could be
automated away (note that I’m talking about more than just a shell
script here). Also what are the best practices around autoscaling groups
andunikernels? Or VPC networks and unikernels?</p>

<h3>The network</h3>

<p>With the explosion in containers and microservices it’s becoming clearer
(if it wasn’t already) how important the network is. By removing the
operating system we remove things like host firewalls and the new breed
of overlay networks. At the same time if we are to tap the dynamic
potential of unikernels we’ll need a similarly dynamic and automatable
network. Maybe this becomes more of an application concern, with
services communicating via other services which act as firewalls and
intelligent proxies, but that still leaves the underlying network to be
managed.</p>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p>However much testing you do beforehand you’ll still likely end up with
problems in production, and as you scale up you’ll hit issues that you
simply can’t recreate outside the live environment. This is were good
debugging capabilities come in. While general purpose operating systems
might be complex they are well know, and tools like ps, top, free, ping,
telnet, netcat, dtrace, etc. are commonly used by anyone debugging
systems. Note that in many cases you’re debugging a combination of
systems; is the performance issue an application problem, a network
problem, a storage problem or some interesting combination of several
facters?</p>

<p>By removing the general purpose operating system, unikernel based
environments remove most of the current debugging tools at the same
time. Part of this Is good application development hygiene (logs,
metrics and status endpoints for instance), but what about the more
interactive debugging practices? What does debugging a system based on
unikernels look like?</p>

<h3>Orchestration</h3>

<p>The word may be overloaded but the need to arrange and manage a number
of components that make up a larger system is a real need. This might be
something like Docker&#39;s Compose file or <a href="https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/learnmore/blueprint-tour.html">Brooklyn&#39;s
Blueprints</a>,
or it could be something more akin to the APIs from Cloud Foundry,
Kubernetes or Mesos. Testing some of these models with unikernel based systems
will be an interesting test of how coupled to containers the existing models are.
The lack of legacy again opens up the potential to come up with a truly
modern alternative here too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Unless you’re in an environment where security is your number 1 concern
then the current state of Unikernels probably means choosing to adopt
them now is a little bleeding edge. But I think that will change over
time as the various projects mature and address some of the issues
described above. In the meantime I’d love to see more discussion of some
of the operational challenges. I think talking about the needs of
operators at this early stage should make the resulting ecosystems more
robust whsen it comes to future production deployments.</p>

        Update to Puppet Module Skeleton
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>Being on holiday last week meant I had a little time for some gardening
of open source projects and I decided to update
<a href="https://www.github.com/garethr/puppet-module-skeleton">puppet-module-skeleton</a>
with some new opinions.</p>

<p>The skeleton is a replacement for the default module skeleton that ships
with Puppet and is used by puppet module generate. Unlike the default
skeleton this one is super-opinionated. It comes bundled with lots of
testing tools, suggestions for documentation, integration with <a href="http://travis-ci.org">Travis
CI</a>, module coverage reports and more.</p>

<p>Updates in the latest version include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Support for Puppet 4 paths</li>
<li>The addition of Rubocop, which enforces parts of the Ruby style guide</li>
<li>Adding a number of Puppet Lint plugins</li>
<li>Allow installing various Puppet versions during integration tests</li>
</ul>

<p>I also fixed a few reported bugs and extended the test matrix to test
across a range of Puppet and Ruby combinations.</p>

<p>The skeleton is intended to help people with a basic understanding of
Puppet write better modules, without having to setup everything
themselves. You don’t have to agree with all the options to make use of
the skeleton as it’s simple enough to delete a few files once you
generate your new module. But a working out-of-the-box beaker install,
and the ability to automatically run unit tests when files change are
patterns worth adopting for most module developers I think.</p>

<p>If anyone has any suggestions for extra tools, or changes to the
skeleton itself, let me know.</p>

      <a href="/2015/05/19/information-security-reading-list/">
        Information Security Reading List
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">19 May 2015</span>

    <p>I read quite a bit (probably a book a week or so) and one of the topics
I&#39;ve been reading on for a while is information security. In a recent
conversation someone asked for some book suggestions, so I thought I&#39;d
write that up in a blog post rather than an email.</p>

<p>Most of this list isn&#39;t particularly technical. It&#39;s not a developers
list of software engineering tomes. If you&#39;re a developer or operator
then I&#39;d recommend reading some of the more policy or journalistic
pieces as well for context. And if you&#39;re just interested in the topic
but nor particularly technical I&#39;d skip the security engineering
suggestions.</p>

<p>Note that I make no claims about this being a particularly balanced
list, it&#39;s biased towards what I find interesting to read. Hopefully
you&#39;ll find it interesting too.</p>

<h2>Journalism</h2>

<p>Understanding why Information Security is important tends to require
some context. The following books provide that, with detailed real-world
stories of criminal and government activities.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dark-Net-Jamie-Bartlett/dp/0434023159">The Dark Net</a> - Jamie Bartlett - an excellent personal tale of

above, this is the story of Conficker and how it was discovered</li>
</ul>

<h1>Policy and context</h1>

<p>These books are focused more on government policy and nation state
threats, and the debate about the rules of war and the internet.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Threat-National-Security/dp/0061962244">Cyber War</a> - Richard Clarke - probably the best description of what
cyber war is and isn&#39;t, and some of the geopolitical problems
emerging.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cyber-War-Will-Take-Place/dp/1849042802">Cyber War Will Not Take Place</a> - Thomas Rid - a good counter to the
above book, with lots more detailed discussion of policy and definition.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Cyber-Warfare-Mapping-Underworld/dp/1449310044">Inside Cyber Warfare</a> - Jeffrey Carr - really just a run through of

      <a href="/2015/05/09/acceptance-testing-mirageos/">
        Acceptance testing MirageOS installs
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 May 2015</span>

    <p>I&#39;m pretty interested in <a href="http://openmirage.org/">MirageOS</a> at the
moment. Partly because I find the idea behind unikernels interesting and
partly because I keep bumping into the nice folks <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/">OCaml
Labs</a> in Cambridge.</p>

<p>In order to write and build your MirageOS unikernel application you need
an OCaml development environment. Although this is
<a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/install">documented</a> I wanted something a
little more repeatable. I also found and reported a few bugs in the
documentation which got me thinking about acceptance testing. I&#39;m not
(yet) an OCaml programmer, but infrastructure automation and testing I
can do.</p>

<h2>Into Puppet</h2>

<p>I started out writing a Puppet module to install and manage everything,
which is now available on
<a href="https://github.com/garethr/garethr-mirageos">GitHub</a> and on the
<a href="https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/mirageos">Forge</a>.</p>

<p>This lets you do something like the following, and have a fully working
MirageOS setup on Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-puppet" data-lang="puppet"><span class="k">class</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s">&#39;mirageos&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">user</span>      <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;vagrant&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="na">opam_root</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s">&#39;/home/vagrant/.opam&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Given time, inclination or pull requests I&#39;ll add support for other
operating systems in the future.</p>

<h2>But how do you know it works?</h2>

<p>The module has a small unit test suite, but it&#39;s nice to know test the
actual running of Puppet and installation of the software. For this I&#39;ve
used <a href="http://kitchen.ci/">Test Kitchen</a> and
<a href="http://serverspec.org/">ServerSpec</a>. This allows for spinning up 2
virtual machines (one for each supported operating system), applying the
Puppet manifest and then making some assertions:</p>

<p>true<script src="https://gist.github.com/a8d090b5d7f7a190f7d9.js"> </script></p>

<p>The above is simply checking whether certain packages are installed, the
PPA is setup correctly and whether <code>mirage</code> and <code>opam</code> can be executed
cleanly.</p>

<h2>Can it produce a working unikernel?</h2>

<p>The above tells us whether the installation worked, but not whether the
resulting software allows us to build MirageOS unikernels. For this I
used <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/bats">Bats</a> running in the same
Test Kitchen setup.</p>

<p>true<script src="https://gist.github.com/191c4c0676b471f9b986.js"> </script></p>

<p>The above configures and builds a simple HTTP server unikernel, and then
checks that when run it returns the expected response on the correct
port.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I like the separation of concerns above. I can use the Puppet code
without the test code, or even swap the Puppet code out for a shell
script if I wanted. I could also run the serverspec tests anywhere I
want to check state, which is the reason for separating those tests from
the one&#39;s building and running a unikernel. Overall the tool chain for ad-hoc
infrastructure testing (quick mention of
<a href="http://infrataster.net/">Infrataster</a> too) is really quite powerful and
approachable. I&#39;d love to see more software ship with a user-facing test
suite for people to verify their installation works.</p>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jan 2015</span>

    <p>My job at Puppet Labs has given me an excuse to take a closer look at
the advancements in Windows automation, in particular <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a>
and <a href="http://boxstarter.org/">BoxStarter</a>. The following is very much a work
in progress but it&#39;s hopefully useful for a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>If like me you&#39;ve mainly been doing non-Windows development for a
while it&#39;s interesting to see what is possible</li>
<li>If you&#39;re starting out with infrastructure development on Windows the
following could be a good starting place</li>
<li>if you&#39;re an experienced Windows pro then you can let me know of any
improvements</li>
</ul>

<p>All that&#39;s needed is to run the following from a CMD or Powershell
prompt on a new Windows machine (you can also visit the URL in Internet
Explorer if you prefer).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">START http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/url?https://gist.githubusercontent.com/garethr/a1838aa68355a0766de4/raw/d92b41ee9dcad68c079d24c64bac7d1d27cf37c7/garethr.ps1

<p>This launches BoxStarter, which executes the following code:</p>

<p>true<script src="https://gist.github.com/a1838aa68355a0766de4.js"> </script></p>

<p>This takes a while as it runs Windows update and repeatedly reboots the

and configured on a newly up-to-date Windows machine.</p>
