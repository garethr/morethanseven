    <p>I&#8217;ve been hacking on appengine again and have thrown up a simple <a href="http://devopstweets.appspot.com/">twitter aggregator for devops</a>. It&#8217;s again based on <a href="http://github.com/steffentchr/twitterengine">TwitterEngine</a> with an increasing number of additions and changes.</p>
<p>As well as just the tweets I want to build a few other small features. The first of which is link extraction, so at the moment you&#8217;ll see recent links a the top of the page. I&#8217;ll hopefully make that a little more useful, with better browing and converting short urls into the real ones. I also have vague plans for providing exports, listing people talking about devops and some useful graphs to track general activity around devops.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really interested to see if the whole discussion around the term devops grows over the next year or so, and I&#8217;m hoping this will make it a little easier to see that change happen.</p>

    <span class="post-date">18 May 2010</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve been playing with <a href="http://integrityapp.com">Integrity</a> again as a simple continuous integration server and have installed it on a few debian and ubuntu machines in the last few weeks. The current site has good installation instructions for the Ruby side of things but leaves it as an excercise for the installer to make sure all the system level dependencies are installed.</p>
<p>So probably as much for me in the future, here is what I had to install to get the installation instructions to work for me.</p>
<% syntax_colorize :bash, type=:coderay do %>
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install ruby
apt-get install rdoc
apt-get install sqlite3
apt-get install libdbd-sqlite3-ruby
apt-get install libdataobjects-sqlite3-ruby1.8 
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
apt-get install libxml2
apt-get install libxml2-dev
apt-get install libxsl-dev
apt-get install libopenssl-ruby
<% end %>
<p>I also needed to install the following package on Ubuntu:</p>
<% syntax_colorize :bash, type=:coderay do %>
apt-get install ruby1.8-dev
<% end %>
<p>If you want to use a database other than the default SQLite then you won&#8217;t need those packages and I&#8217;ll assume you know what you&#8217;re doing.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m just getting back from Newcastle after getting to present at the first Design It Build It conference. It was great to be back up in Newcastle and to see lots of familiar faces. As with most conferences it was also good to meet new people (especially those for whom it was their first conference) and to listen to people talking about interesting stuff. Personal highlights for me were David Singleton from Last.fm and Michael Brunton Spall from The Guardian going through really interesting case studies from their respective organisations. It&#8217;s the sort of gritty content it&#8217;s often hard to come by. Speaking did mean I missed out on most of the design track unfrotunately, but videos should be available soon and by all accounts it sounds like the larger designer crowd went home happy.</p>

<p>I think my presentation at <a href="http://dibiconference.co.uk"><span class="caps">DIBI</span></a> went OK. I&#8217;d got a little bit carried away with cramming content in, which meant it felt rushed at times and I still went over by 5 minutes into my Q&amp;A time. But hey, a few people said nice things afterwards.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell the world (of web developers) about as many different tools as I could. I think most people who read this blog have probably come across most of this software, heck you might be commiting code to it or already using it in production. But lots of people haven&#8217;t ever heard of Memcached, never mind Cassandra or RabbitMQ. And more inportant than the specific software is the differnt types of tools available. Small web servers, message queues, <span class="caps">HTTP</span> caches, etc. Conferences are a good place to find and educate people. Hopefully I managed to do just that.</p>
<p>One thing I hope I got across, I&#8217;m not for a moment saying you shouldn&#8217;t be using tools you know and love. Nor am I saying you should jump in and start using lots of crazy software. But keeping an eye on new developments can serve you well when it comes to deciding whether the best approach is really to build something from scratch. I&#8217;ve spoken to several people over the last few weeks who where starting to write simple queing systems using cron and mysql, or using a hand rolled file system based caching setup. And in both cases I think they would be better served by existing tools.</p>
<p>My slides had <em>a lot</em> of links in them and I mentioned during my talk I&#8217;m put a list of them somewhere:</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m at barcamp cambridge this weekend and decided to do a short talk on devops. It&#8217;s still a term that not too many people have come across and something that lots of people building websites should think about.</p>

<p>I put the slides together this morning so much of it will be familiar to people who have been reading the same blog posts as me over the last year or so. For anyone else either just finding out about the whole world of operations or old hand sysadmins finding likeminded people hopefully the slides will be useful.</p>

        DIBI Twitter Aggregator

    <span class="post-date">19 Apr 2010</span>

    <p>So, <a href="http://dibiconference.com/"><span class="caps">DIBI</span></a> is just over a week away and lots of people seem to be getting excited. Personally I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. I get a nice trip back up to my old home of Newcastle and get to talk geek to an audience of likeminded (and not so likeminded) web professionals. I&#8217;m also going to catch up with quite a few people I haven&#8217;t seen in quite a while.</p>
<p>Anyway, Twitter is at it&#8217;s best at conferences like this. It&#8217;s perfect for the <em>where to go now</em> situation. But I also like going back in time after the fact and looking at what people said, especially to get feedback about my talk. With that in mind I&#8217;ve build a <a href="http://dibiconf.appspot.com/">little aggregator</a> for all things #dibi. So far that appears to be a mixture of excitement and travel chaos.</p>
<p>I specifically wanted something that ran on the server, which discounted an awful lot of pure javascript versions. I think Twitter clients generally do a good job of the <em>right now</em> anyway. I also like to collect data for mining later, assuming I have the time. After a number of discussions on Twitter, then just some wandering around GitHub I found <a href="http://github.com/steffentchr/twitterengine">TwitterEngine</a> which is fantastic. I&#8217;ve hacked it around quite a bit into something more general purpose. I&#8217;ve added some caching, some other App Engine performance tweaks and some monitoring. I&#8217;ll commit those to GitHub when I get the chance. I&#8217;d forgotten quite how much fun App Engine development was.</p>
<p>I still want to add a few more features before the conference. The styles work quite well on my Android but less well (text too small) on my iPod Touch. So I&#8217;ll fix that first. Any other requests?</p>
