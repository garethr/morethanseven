        Universal Internet Explorer 6 CSS and different types of sites
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 May 2009</span>

    <p>Andy Clarke, as only he can, has started something of a slagging match with his proposals for a <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/blog/about/universal_internet_explorer_6_css/">single, central IE6 stylesheet</a>. My first impression was that this is basically a much better version of the browser defaults.</p>
<p>Between backslapping and shouts of heresy there are a few good comments floating on the post so far (I&#8217;d expect more). But most of them seem to assume only two types of website exist:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Websites for <em>clients</em>. You know, business to business or business to consumer sorts of things. Online stores, radio station websites, newspapers, company brochures, etc.</li>
	<li>Personal blogs</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously that covers only a fraction of web pages, but it covers a much larger proportion of web sites. What do I mean by that?</p>
<ol>
	<li>Admin interfaces. Available all over the place and often used by a very small number of people.</li>
	<li>Intranets. If your company default browser isn&#8217;t IE6 then don&#8217;t spend more time that you have to supporting it.</li>
	<li>Internal application interfaces. Everything from holiday to payroll to IT helpdesk requests are often built as well apps. Again if the audience using them isn&#8217;t using IE6 then don&#8217;t waste you&#8217;re time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most people (ok so this might be my opinion) seem to work within small to medium sized agency style places. Smallish companies need to rely more on employees as part of their marketing effort, younger people tend to be more militant and people working for smaller organisations (like Andy) tend to benefit more from a little celebrity. But that ignores an army of people who work in house or in other types of company that just happen to build top notch web sites or applications. I&#8217;ve now worked in everything from small agencies, via medium sized agencies to freelance and inhouse. They are all different and all place different types of time pressure on the people involved.</p>
<p>Another argument to be had here is summed up by Sion (<a href="http://twitter.com/sionnnn/status/1872141409">http://twitter.com/sionnnn/status/1872141409</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if u write code with all browsers in mind from the offset it doesn&#8217;t take any longer though? hows that commercially unsound?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is pretty much how I used to work. But this means ignoring whole swathes of the unsupported parts of CSS2 and in particular CSS3. CSS3 doesn&#8217;t really allow you to make designs that you couldn&#8217;t make before (ok, that&#8217;s a little unfair, maybe) but it does allow you to do what you did before <em>much more efficiently</em>. Multi-column layout stuff, multiple background, rounded corners, opacity, RGBa. Smaller stylesheets are easier and quicker to write, test and maintain. And sometimes the time saved is worth more than the additional overhead of writing and maintaining <span class="caps">CSS</span> for IE6. Maybe not for a decent sized consumer project with a reasonable team and a few hundred thousand budget. Maybe not for a local council or government site. But for a surprisingly large range of other types of projects this might be a worthwhile approach.</p>
<p>Something else I think that comes through in many of the comments is that it&#8217;s often seen as the web designers job to fight for things. So we fight to ensure time is spend on making something accessible. We fight to make sure we use valid code wherever possible. We fight for sensible fallbacks when javascript isn&#8217;t available. But we also get accused of not being able to see both sides and at times being unrealistic. Worth considering with regards peoples initial reactions to this, mine included.</p>
<p>The only thing I would say to anyone looking to use this is don&#8217;t create your own version. Use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/universal-ie6-css/">one from google code</a>. As Andy suggests, do suggest improvements, ideally by making the changes yourself presumably along with a solid test case. The time saving benefits basically disappear if we all have to maintain our own versions, before that means we have to test our own versions.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying <em>ignore IE6</em>, and neither is Andy (I don&#8217;t think). I&#8217;m saying pick your battles. I&#8217;ve build websites to support everything under the sun. Sometimes it&#8217;s been absolutely the right thing to do, sometimes in hindsight it&#8217;s probably been a little bit of wasted time. I&#8217;m sure you can think of similar times from the sites you&#8217;ve been involved in.</p>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2009</span>

    <p>After what seems like longer than a year I&#8217;ve finally managed to make it back up to Newcastle. It&#8217;s the <a href="http://www/thinkingdigital.com">Thinking Digital</a> conference again this year and so far it&#8217;s been a hoot. A mix of practical, inspirational and just odd speakers (and acts) suits me pretty well. Lots of <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23tdc">twitter activity</a> too.</p>
<p>The highlights for me so far I think has been Dan Lyons talking about the future of media and print businesses. Basically a somewhat rambling attempt to describe where newspapers and print publications find themselves in this day and age (in trouble) and where they might head for salvation (either dumbing down or becoming more exclusive/expensive). Throw in interesting stories and anecdotes, the odd joke and some personal thoughts on the future for journalists and everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>
<p>An honorable mention goes to Johnny Lee Chung as well for showing off drag and drop between a laptop and a table. Oh, and everything else has been pretty interesting as well and it&#8217;s not even the end of day one yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m around until next week too, which means I should be able to get along to barcamp &#8211; assuming my mind hasn&#8217;t melted with all the stuff to take in.</p>

    <p>So, it was the <a href="http://www.bamboojuice.co.uk/">Bamboo Juice</a> conference last Friday at the rather impressive Eden project in Cornwall. Along with <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://www.thehodge.co.uk/">Dom</a>, <a href="http://boagworld.com/">Paul</a> and <a href="http://www.scatteredpoppies.com/">Relly</a> I presented to the crowd of mainly local first time web conference goers.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=selfeducationforwebprofessionals-090427034436-phpapp02&stripped_title=self-education-for-web-professionals" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=selfeducationforwebprofessionals-090427034436-phpapp02&stripped_title=self-education-for-web-professionals" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>It was a great event, and felt a lot like the first Highland Fling in that it was the first big event in an area that&#8217;s actually quite a distance from the bright lights of London (it took 8 hours to get back to Cambridge). The party afterwards, held in one of the biomes at the Eden project itself, was also pretty impressive.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully right up some of my notes from the presentation soon, but for the moment I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/garethr/self-education-for-web-professionals">uploaded the slides to Slideshare</a>. The whole thing was video&#8217;d as well so look out for those in the future.</p>

        Simple issue tracking

    <span class="post-date">12 Apr 2009</span>

    <p>Another project I hacked together on the train running on App Engine I&#8217;m afraid. Anyone getting bored of my <em>new project each week</em> posts please stop reading now.</p>
<p><a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com"><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjZNgw" alt="GitBug interface"/></a></p>
<p>Issue or bug tracking is just one of those things we all deal with and probably have opinions on. Lots of open source software exists (<a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">BugZilla</a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>) to do the job and various companies have commercial products (<a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="http://sifterapp.com/">Sifter</a>, <a href="http://hedgehoglab.com/products/fixx/">Fixx</a>). So why did I go and create another one?</p>
<p>Certainly not because I think I can do a better job for the majority. This is very much a personal pet project and I don&#8217;t very much fancy competing with teams of smart people building good products.</p>
<p>Like most software projects my issue tracker was designed to scratch a personal itch. I now have 28 repos over on <a href="http://github.com/garethr">GitHub</a> (how did that happen?). Some of these are public projects I&#8217;d like other peoples input on, and for me that means having a public list of issues. But these aren&#8217;t active projects being worked on by a team of people &#8211; it&#8217;s mainly just me (with Brad and Simon occasionally correcting my spelling and grammar) hacking on the train to work and back. I don&#8217;t need collaboration features. I don&#8217;t want to be limited to a small number of projects. I&#8217;d rather not pay lots of money, or worry too much about hosting.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s where <a href="http://gitbug.appspot.com">GitBug</a> comes in. Bug tracking for people with minimal needs.</p>
<p>The only real <em>feature</em> past a very minimal bug tracker is the ability to close bugs via a GitHub webhook. Oh and lots of <span class="caps">JSON</span> and <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for everything but that&#8217;s just the way we should build things now anyway.</p>
<p>Their are areas of the interface that could do with some streamlining and a couple of open bugs that don&#8217;t yet cause me enough pain to fix. I have however opened it up for anyone with a Google account to use and a few people have started adding their own projects and issues already. I&#8217;m hoping that for the most part by keeping it as simple as possible I can avoid having to do any work on <em>it</em> and work on bugs in other projects instead, of which I&#8217;m sure there are many.</p>

        Support for Rev=Canonical

    <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2009</span>

    <p>There has been <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1566/">lots of talk</a> recently about <span class="caps">URL</span> shortening. Services like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> have been around for a good while, offering shortened versions of URLs like <a href="http://tinyurl.com/dd7w2m">tinyurl.com/dd7w2m</a> which are easier to put in a tweet or an email. The problem with this is that not only does the shorter version mask any information about the destination, but if TinyURL or one of the other shortening services goes away, or loses control of it&#8217;s domain name, a large number of links are going to stop working the way they should.</p>
<p><a href="http://laughingmeme.org/">Kellan</a> in particular has been proposing some simple steps that might get us out of this hole. You can read more about the ideas behind using <a href="http://revcanonical.wordpress.com/">Rev=Canonical</a> and try out the future (maybe) of these services at <a href="http://revcanonical.appspot.com">revcanonical.appspot.com</a>.</p>
<p>The nicest thing from my point of view about this idea is how simple it is to implement. This blog is running a custom Django based blogging engine called <a href="http://github.com/garethr/django-train/tree/master">Train</a>.</p>
<p>The posts on this site exist at urls like the following: <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/04/04/mixing-it-programming-language-choice/">morethanseven.net/2009/04/04/mixing-it-programming-language-choice/</a>. With only a small view function, a change to a template and the addition of a url this blog should now work with Kellans new url shortener.</p>
<p>I decided to use the ids for the articles on the blog as the key for the short versions. So if you were to visit <a href="http://morethanseven.net/284">morethanseven.net/284</a> you would get the article above. I decided to issue a redirect from the short version to the long version in the end rather than serve duplicate content with the canonical link, not sure which way is probably best though.</p>
<p>The markup for each article contains the required link in the head of the document:</p>
<pre>&lt;link rel="alternate shorter" href="http://morethanseven.net/284"&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</pre>
<p>And the django view looks something like this:</p>
<pre>def tiny(request, id):
    "Provide tiny urls based on ids for articles"
    # get the article or throw a 404
    article = get_object_or_404(Article, id=id, status='live')
    url = article.get_absolute_url()
    # redirect to the relevant
    return HttpResponsePermanentRedirect(url)</pre>
<p>All in all, incredible simply to implement, especially in something like Rails or Django which make this sort of wire up urls to view stuff easy. So what&#8217;s stopping you adding this to you site or current project? If enough people just do it we can make the web a slightly better place in reasonably short order.</p>
