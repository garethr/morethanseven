        How to Decide on Your Next Programming Language
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2009</span>

    <p><a href="http://neilcrosby.com/">Neil Crosby</a> got me thinking yesterday about which language to learn/play with next by <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilCrosby/statuses/2090500164">tweeting</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so, lovely people of the interwebs. What webly language should I be spending my time learning then? Right now, I&#8217;m all about the <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil appears to have gone for Python, but more specifically I&#8217;m interested in how you decide what to learn next? And improving the likelihood of you seeing it through and being able to add it to you toolbox. Personally I&#8217;ve messed around with a wide range of languages but I would say I&#8217;m proficient in only a few of those.</p>
<p>So here goes with a list of questions to ask yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have a small pet project you can use the new language on straight away?</li>
	<li>Is the language increasing or decreasing in popularity?</li>
	<li>Does the language overlap with what you already know in terms of applicability?</li>
	<li>Is it a different style of programming to what you&#8217;re used to? Say a pure functional language if all you normally do is object orientated.</li>
	<li>Is the language in demand in the jobs market? If not why not?</li>
	<li>Could you use the language in your current job if you were allowed to?</li>
	<li>What are the learning materials like? Are there books or websites that teach the language without passing on bad practices.</li>
	<li>What is the community around a language like? Do they have an <span class="caps">IRC</span> room where beginners can ask questions without being mocked?</li>
	<li>Does the language have an interactive mode? Sorry but I find anything without to be a chore to learn.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of time? Remember some languages are bigger that others.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of money? Do you need specialist software, or hardware, or licenses?</li>
	<li>Do you have friends or acquaintances who use the language and who will help you out with pointing you in the right direction of resources or helping review your code?</li>
	<li>Do you have somewhere you can go to meet other people who write the language. That might be a formal user group or it might just be a more general pub meetup that you know a few people attend.</li>
	<li>How is the language represented on GitHub? Seeing what other people build and being able to read working code is hugely useful when learning anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think all of these apply to everyone or apply all the time, but it&#8217;s worth considering and rejecting them when they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Feel free to disagree in the comments or, even better, add extra ones. Or alternatively just cut to the chase and tell me what I should learn next.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve updated my vanity domain at <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">garethrushgrove.com</a> with a bit of information in case anyone might be interested in my services.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjDPgw" alt="my personal site"/></p>
<p>The short version is I&#8217;m on the lookout for future projects, probably of a freelance or contract basis but if it&#8217;s particularly interesting then maybe a full time position. Basically I&#8217;m in quite a nice position and able to wander about a bit looking for something cool to do.</p>
<p>If you reading this site then you know what floats my boat. Python, testing, automation, system design, maybe get into Ruby or another language properly, etc. I&#8217;d particularly like to help people get started with testing, continuous integration or automated deployment and the like.</p>

    <p>I found myself wanted something to make writing high level, functional tests for <span class="caps">WSGI</span> application easier and quicker. If I liked the term I&#8217;d call it a domain specific language for testing URLs. Basically I found myself writing a lot of tests like:</p>
<pre>def test_404_handler(self):  
    response = self.app.get('/does-not-exist', expect_errors=True)        
    self.assertEquals("404 Not Found", response.status)</pre>
<p>Testing more than a view URLs like this got boring quickly. What I wanted was a short hand syntax for defining this sort of simple test and then running them all individually. So was born <a href="http://github.com/garethr/urltest/tree/master">Urltest</a>. It uses the rather nifty <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/WebTest/0.9">Webtest</a> module and hooks into unittest from the standard library. You&#8217;re test script then looks a little like:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env python
from example_app import application
from urltest import verify_urls
if __name__ == "__main__":
    urls = (
        {'url':"/", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/bob", 'code':200},
        {'url':"/jim", 'code':404},
        {'url':"/jim", 'method': "POST", 'code':405},
    )    
    verify_urls(urls, application)</pre>
<p>Let me know if you use it as at the moment this is <em>works for me</em> ware, although it&#8217;s reasonably well tested and commented.</p>

        Another Glue Python Framework - MNML

    <span class="post-date">28 May 2009</span>

    <p>Although still a big fan of Django, but for some problems I&#8217;m finding more and more cases where I prefer less code and more freedom. My biggest issue for some types of problems being Django&#8217;s assumption that you&#8217;ll be using a relational database, or a database at all. Django wasn&#8217;t the reason I started using webapp for App Engine stuff, but in doing so I found that webapp often did all that I needed.</p>
<p>So when I small, non appengine project cropped up I started looking at the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks">different options available</a> and played with a few of them.</p>
<ul>
	<li>I played with Pylons but again got lost in code. I&#8217;ll probably play with Pylons more in the future and for bigger, team based, projects it looks a good mix of component parts and shared conventions.</li>
	<li>Web.py &#8211; I&#8217;d used web.py before I started with Django (I even wrote a very <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2007/01/03/webphp/">basic <span class="caps">PHP</span> clone</a>) and although I still like somethings about it, it felt like more code than was required for what I wanted.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/breily/juno/tree/master">Juno</a> is similar in design to Sinatra but again it wasn&#8217;t really what I was after this time. I prefer separating my routing from my code and I&#8217;m not sure I like that it comes with it&#8217;s own templating engine.</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/JaredKuolt/newf/tree/master">Newf</a> was more like it. Basically a hugely stripped down <span class="caps">WSGI</span> framework which provides the very basic building blocks. Something to build on perhaps?</li>
	<li><a href="http://github.com/bradleywright/mnml/tree/master"><span class="caps">MNML</span></a> (by an ex-colleague <a href="http://intranation.com/">Brad Wright</a>) is build atop Newf adding a few more features and cleaning up some of the interfaces. My only problems here were that I prefer regex based routes and wanted individual methods for each <span class="caps">HTTP</span> verb. The former was a specific design decision Brad had made in order to be able to reverse routes, the later was on the todo list.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I set <a href="http://github.com/garethr/mnml/tree/master">about forking <span class="caps">MNML</span> to create my own branch</a>. I added extra comments as I was making my way through the code, wrote a few tests to checks thinks worked and allowed for pluggable routing mechanisms. <span class="caps">MNML</span> applications look a bit like the following:</p>
<pre>from mnml import RegexBasedApplication, RequestHandler, HttpResponse, development_server
class HelloWorld(RequestHandler):
    def GET(self):
        return HttpResponse("&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;")
routes = (
    (r'^/$', HelloWorld),
)
application = RegexBasedApplication(routes)
if __name__ == '__main__':
    development_server(application)</pre>
<p>If you want to use the token based routing you would substitute in something like the following:</p>
<pre>routes = (
    ('/', Foo),
    ('/myview/:stuff/', Bar)
)
application = TokenBasedApplication(routes)</pre>
<p>The best bit is that it&#8217;s only about 350 lines of code, a great deal of which is accounted for by comments. It&#8217;s also really quite fast &#8211; especially using something like spawning to run the <span class="caps">WSGI</span> application. The other thing I like is the ease with which you can add <span class="caps">WSGI</span> middleware into the mix.</p>
<p>So, if you have a small scale problem where simple and fast beats everything else then have a look and let me know what you think. It will take less time to read the code and tests than it will be read the introductory chapter on whichever larger framework you choose to look at.</p>
