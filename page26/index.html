    <p>Ruby people <em>really</em> don&#8217;t like <span class="caps">CSS</span> do they? But <a href="http://lesscss.org/">Less</a> is actually pretty cool. It&#8217;s basically an attempt to bootstrap features, specifically Variables, Mixins, Operations and Nested Rules, into <span class="caps">CSS</span>. The best part about this is it uses <span class="caps">CSS</span> syntax and a simple one step compiler. I&#8217;d be interested to know what the folks at the W3C think about this.</p>
<p>So for instance you can do:</p>
<pre>/* LESS */
@brand_color: #4D926F;
#header {
  color: @brand_color;
}
h2 {
  color: @brand_color;
}</pre>
<p>and compile it down to:</p>
<pre>/* CSS */
#header {
  color: #4D926F;
}
h2 {
  color: #4D926F;
}</pre>

        Message Queues at Cambridge Geek Night

    <p>Last night was the first Cambridge Geek Night and saw 35 people or so fill a room above a pub to listen to a few short talks and converse with fellow geeks. I had the pleasure of giving the first talk, a short introduction to using message queues for web developers.</p>
<p><object style="margin:0px" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=messagequeues-090611064000-phpapp01&stripped_title=message-queues-for-web-applications" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>I got lots of good questions from interested people and by the sounds of things it had the desired effect &#8211; for people unfamiliar with using a message queue to go out and have a play with some of the cool software available to solve your problems.</p>
<p>Overall the night was definitely a success. Suitably geeky conversations. A chance to meet new people as well as old friends. Good job <a href="http://www.thatcanadiangirl.co.uk/">Vero</a> and <a href="http://blog.fatbusinessman.com/">David</a> for organising the event and here&#8217;s to the next one.</p>

        How to Decide on Your Next Programming Language
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Jun 2009</span>

    <p><a href="http://neilcrosby.com/">Neil Crosby</a> got me thinking yesterday about which language to learn/play with next by <a href="http://twitter.com/NeilCrosby/statuses/2090500164">tweeting</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>so, lovely people of the interwebs. What webly language should I be spending my time learning then? Right now, I&#8217;m all about the <span class="caps">PHP</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neil appears to have gone for Python, but more specifically I&#8217;m interested in how you decide what to learn next? And improving the likelihood of you seeing it through and being able to add it to you toolbox. Personally I&#8217;ve messed around with a wide range of languages but I would say I&#8217;m proficient in only a few of those.</p>
<p>So here goes with a list of questions to ask yourself.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have a small pet project you can use the new language on straight away?</li>
	<li>Is the language increasing or decreasing in popularity?</li>
	<li>Does the language overlap with what you already know in terms of applicability?</li>
	<li>Is it a different style of programming to what you&#8217;re used to? Say a pure functional language if all you normally do is object orientated.</li>
	<li>Is the language in demand in the jobs market? If not why not?</li>
	<li>Could you use the language in your current job if you were allowed to?</li>
	<li>What are the learning materials like? Are there books or websites that teach the language without passing on bad practices.</li>
	<li>What is the community around a language like? Do they have an <span class="caps">IRC</span> room where beginners can ask questions without being mocked?</li>
	<li>Does the language have an interactive mode? Sorry but I find anything without to be a chore to learn.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of time? Remember some languages are bigger that others.</li>
	<li>What is it going to cost you in terms of money? Do you need specialist software, or hardware, or licenses?</li>
	<li>Do you have friends or acquaintances who use the language and who will help you out with pointing you in the right direction of resources or helping review your code?</li>
	<li>Do you have somewhere you can go to meet other people who write the language. That might be a formal user group or it might just be a more general pub meetup that you know a few people attend.</li>
	<li>How is the language represented on GitHub? Seeing what other people build and being able to read working code is hugely useful when learning anything.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think all of these apply to everyone or apply all the time, but it&#8217;s worth considering and rejecting them when they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Feel free to disagree in the comments or, even better, add extra ones. Or alternatively just cut to the chase and tell me what I should learn next.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;ve updated my vanity domain at <a href="http://garethrushgrove.com">garethrushgrove.com</a> with a bit of information in case anyone might be interested in my services.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cgwLEgVJbWFnZRjDPgw" alt="my personal site"/></p>
<p>The short version is I&#8217;m on the lookout for future projects, probably of a freelance or contract basis but if it&#8217;s particularly interesting then maybe a full time position. Basically I&#8217;m in quite a nice position and able to wander about a bit looking for something cool to do.</p>
<p>If you reading this site then you know what floats my boat. Python, testing, automation, system design, maybe get into Ruby or another language properly, etc. I&#8217;d particularly like to help people get started with testing, continuous integration or automated deployment and the like.</p>
