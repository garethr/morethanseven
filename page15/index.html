        Devops Isn't A Methodology
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>I was reading <a href="http://teddziuba.com/2011/03/devops-scam.html">Devops is a poorly executed scam</a> and just couldn&#8217;t resist a reply. Not because of the entertaining title, but because I both agree and disagree quite strongly with parts of the post. Read it first if you haven&#8217;t already. And yes I know I&#8217;m feeding the internet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to pick parts of the post out and then comment. Hopefully I&#8217;m not quoting these in any way out of context.</p>
<h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s got the potential to make a handful of people a lot of money in the same way that Agile did, but nobody is really executing on.&#8221;</h2>
<p>People are pretty aware of this fact I think, but watch what happens when people post on the mailing lists or turn up at community events with a purely marketing hat on. They just get no traction and even damage their product brand amongst the early adopters. The fact the term is starting to get used in job adverts and marketing materials isn&#8217;t really being driven by the people talking about what devops might or might not be. I think the main reason for this is that most of the people I talk to in person or online are actually pretty happy with their jobs and generally work inside companies rather than as independent consultants. They have often reached an age where they want to improve within a given field but would like a wider network than their current colleagues to discuss things with.</p>
<h2>&#8220;How do you implement Devops?&#8221;</h2>
<p>I don&#8217;t think you do. The comparisons with Agile are interesting from a community point of view but Scrum is a methodology. To me at least devops isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just a banner or tag under which interesting conversations are happening. The argument that &#8220;You should be doing this anyway. Not earth shattering.&#8221; is a good thing. You&#8217;d be suprised by how many people don&#8217;t do all the things they should be doing, especially in small and young companies. And one of the reasons for that is no one bothered writing a list of these things down anywhere and then discussing them. I&#8217;m not saying this huge list exists or even whether it should, but the discussion is happening.</p>
<h2>&#8220;The underlying problem, however, is that dev and ops have different goals&#8221;</h2>
<p>This is spot on. I think this maybe does get missed in talk that focuses more on tools but not in the wider discussion happening about business improvements. Devops quite litterally brings those two things together. You&#8217;ll always have individual goals but where you have separate operations and development teams they should have the same fundamental goals.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Developers develop in the same environment production runs in If you deploy to Linux, you develop on Linux. No more of this coding on your Macbook Pro and deploying to Ubuntu: that is why you can&#8217;t have nice things.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Yes, yes and yes again. I&#8217;m definitely from the developer side of the tracks and I&#8217;m constantly telling people this and it&#8217;s definitely something I don&#8217;t see enough people doing. What I&#8217;d love is for all the operations people to state this to their development team and most importantly to help them set that up. Just saying <em>work like me or I won&#8217;t let you near the production machines</em> is just being obstructive. Educating and helping with tooling helps build those bridges and trust. And with trust comes the access the developers want. And less stupid bugs and less deployment issues with differing package dependencies.</p>
<h2>&#8220;None of this amounts to a methodology, as the Devops people would have you believe.&#8221;</h2>
<p>Still unsure which Devops people are saying it&#8217;s a bonefide methodology. I see the word used sometimes but generally in passing and not I don&#8217;t think meant how you mean here. And I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard people speak about it in person. &#8220;Scrum methodology&#8221; returns more than 113,000 results in Google. &#8220;Devops methodology&#8221; returns about 150, some of which 404 and half of which are agregators pointing at the other half.</p>
<h2>&#8220;The Devops movement smells of a scam in the making&#8221;</h2>
<p>Some company or other is definitely going to be scammed into paying over the odds for a consultant because they used the word Devops in the sales pitch. That will have next to nothing to do with what I&#8217;d see as the Devops movement and everything to do with human nature (and sales people).</p>

        A Continuous Deployment Example Setup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>One of the reasons behind getting around to building <a href="http://www.vagrantbox.es">Vagrantbox.es</a> recently was I was giving a talk to a group of startups on <a href="http://thedifferenceengine.eu/">The Difference Engine</a> programme and I wanted to have an example project to demonstrate various things. I wanted to demonstrate everything from sensible version control habbits, configuration management, basic orcestration and most importantly a solid deployment process. I&#8217;ve decided to write up what I&#8217;m doing for deployment because I think it&#8217;s pretty nice, and for all the talk about Continuous Deployment I haven&#8217;t seen many examples of code and configuration to make it happen.</p>
<p>Most of what I&#8217;ll cover is pretty easy to map to whatever technologies your using. For this project I&#8217;d gone for Git, Django, Gunicorn, Nginx, Fabric, Mysql and Jenkins and I&#8217;m deploying to Ubuntu running on <a href="http://www.brightbox.co.uk/">Brightbox Cloud</a>. Apart from the Jenkins instance in the middle you could follow the instructions and swap things out easily.</p>
<h2>Jenkins</h2>
<p>First up lets install <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a>. I setup a separate cloud instance just to run the Continuous Integration server. I find this approach easier to manage but you could always run this locally if you prefer. The Jenkins folk provide very up to date <a href="http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian/">packages for Debian</a> so I chose to use those.</p>
<h3>Plugins</h3>
<p>Jenkins provides a huge number of optional plugins which enable various additional features. Plugins are installed via the web interface at /pluginManager. I&#8217;ve installed:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin">Jenkins Cobertura Plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin">Jenkins <span class="caps">GIT</span> plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin">GitHub plugin</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Green+Balls">Green Balls</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Violations">Hudson Violations plugin</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Only the Git plugin is really required for what I&#8217;m doing with deployment. Cobertura and Violations are code quality metrics tools that I use to record output from pylint and code coverage for my test suite.</p>
<h2>The Source</h2>
<p>My finished project was already on GitHub in a private repository. I&#8217;m using a requirements.txt file to record python dependencies so I can use pip to install them automatically and I&#8217;m using Virtualenv to sandbox this installation. I&#8217;m also using South to manage my database schema changes. I won&#8217;t go into that here as it&#8217;s pretty Python specific, Rails for instance has Active Record migrations, <span class="caps">RVM</span> and Bundler which do pretty much the same job. <span class="caps">PHP</span> has <span class="caps">PEAR</span> and some of the frameworks offer a migration tool.</p>
<p>I then created two projects in Jenkins:</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiRywEM" alt="Jenkins dashboard"/></p>
<h3>Project 1: Vagrantboxes</h3>
<p>This is the main build of my master branch in Git. As well as setting up the Git repo as shown below I&#8217;ve set a polling schedule to */5 * * * * (that&#8217;s every 5 minutes) and also set Trigger builds remotely so I can have a task in my fabfile which triggers a build immediately.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjh2gEM" alt="Git config for Jenkins"/></p>
<p>I then have two build steps, both of which execute shell commands. The first installs any new requirements via pip:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "source bin/activate; pip install -r requirements.txt"</pre>
<p>The second runs my test suite and generates the <span class="caps">XML</span> output required to show the test results in Jenkins:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "source bin/activate; cd vagrantboxes/configs/common; python manage.py jenkins boxes"</pre>
<p>I&#8217;m using the rather handy <a href="https://github.com/kmmbvnr/django-jenkins">Django Jenkins</a> application for this.</p>
<p>So far so good. This gives us a project that, when we push some changes to GitHub, will pull those changes down to the CI server and run our test suite, giving us feedback as to whether the tests pass or fail.</p>
<p>Now for the trick, in Post-build Actions tick Build other projects and specify the name of another project that we&#8217;ll setup next. Mine is called Vagrantboxes-deploy.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRirwwEM" alt="Post build action in Jenkins"/></p>
<h3>Project 2: Vagrantboxes-deploy</h3>
<p>This project is triggered only when the previous project runs successfully. And all it&#8217;s going to do is run the deployment script on the project we just built. The setup for this project is very simply, it has one build step which just executes the following:</p>
<pre>bash -l -c "cd /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Vagrantboxes/workspace; source bin/activate; fab appserver deploy"</pre>
<p>The specifics of the Fabric script here aren&#8217;t that important but I&#8217;m doing something not too disimilar to <a href="http://morethanseven.net/2009/07/27/fabric-django-git-apache-mod_wsgi-virtualenv-and-p.html">what I described here</a>.</p>
<p>The reason I&#8217;ve setup a separate project for these is so I can, if I choose, trigger a deployment separately to the full build, and also so I can very easily disable deployments even if the main build is still running.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>With this setup whenever I push code to master it triggers a build. If the test suite passes it runs the deployment script and pushes out the code to the live web servers. This suites me and this project but you might find it easier to start by pushing all successfull builds out to a staging environment. And maybe then moving on to having a new project which is only triggered manually for deploying to production.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRiqwwEM" alt="project view in Jenkins"/></p>
<p>This setup has other advantages too. The Jenkins dashboard becomes a handy tool for recording deployment events. You can easily setup emails or IM messages or Campfire posts to alert other team members whenever a deployment happens. And it really really makes sure your delployment scripts work without hand holding.</p>
<p>This is a simple project that I&#8217;m working on on my own, but in a team environment you&#8217;d likely have a more complex branching strategy and more Jenkins projects. You might also introduce some gateways for manual testing but the starting point is the same. Jenkins makes archiving successful build artifacts relatively easy as well, this setup has a few race condition possibilities that you can fix by building artifacts from successful builds. Jenkins also supports building from different branches and having different branches trigger different projects, all handy if you want to grow this kind of setup.</p>

        Site For Vagrant Base Boxes

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>A brief <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/garethr/status/40785392445685760">conversation with Matt Keating</a> on Twitter finally pushed me over the edge and I&#8217;ve built a site I&#8217;d been meaning to do for a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a huge <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> fan, but one thing that often comes up is where to find base boxes. My newly launched site <a href="http://vagrantbox.es">Vagranbox.es</a> provides just that. At the moment that just means user submitted boxes being checked and then posted. I&#8217;ll likely add comments and ratings and the like if things become popular but that&#8217;s for later.</p>
<p><img src="http://image-host.appspot.com/i/img?id=agppbWFnZS1ob3N0cg0LEgVJbWFnZRjBuwEM" alt="vargrantbox.es homepage"/></p>
<p>So, if you know of or host a useful box please let me know. I&#8217;ll try to keep up with any submissions.</p>

        Devops - More Than Marketing - Talk By James Turnbull
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Mar 2011</span>

    <p>I&#8217;ve just found my notes from <a href="http://kartar.net">James Turnbull&#8217;s</a> talk at <a href="http://fosdem.org"><span class="caps">FOSDEM</span></a>. I found the talk excellent, and I&#8217;m already part of the choir. But much of the audience I&#8217;d guess have only come across the devops term in passing, or worse had it pushed at them as part of marketing materials. Hopefully I captured the main points:</p>
<h2>So what is devops all about?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cooperation (between development and operations teams)</li>
	<li>Buzzword bingo?</li>
	<li>Pop culture movement?</li>
	<li>Discussion</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s early days</li>
	<li>No one has all the answers</li>
	<li>Nothing is fixed in stone</li>
	<li>It&#8217;s all about outreach</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s about</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Simplicity &#8211; Repeatable, Reusable, Easy to communicate</li>
	<li>Relationships &#8211; Engage early, engage often, &#8220;Toss it over the fence&#8221;, Talk to people</li>
	<li>Process &#8211; Test everything, Automate everything, Redundancy and expectation of failure, Transparent and open to everyone</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Not just ops tools &#8211; Config mnagement, Deployment and orchestration, Monitoring, Security, Testing</li>
	<li>Use for entire lifecycle dev &#8594; test &#8594; ops</li>
	<li>Not just dev tools &#8211; Version control, Agile, Application architecture</li>
	<li>Testing methodology &#8211; Low level vs functional</li>
	<li>Documentation &#8211; &#8220;The only time the network diagram is up to date is after the post mortem&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Continuous improvement</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Nothing stands still &#8211; Customers, Products, Technology, Your team</li>
	<li>Strike often, striek hard, be aggressive</li>
</ul>
<h2>It&#8217;s a culture change</h2>
<ul>
	<li>This is Hard</li>
	<li>People hate change</li>
	<li>People hate people who introduce change</li>
	<li>Fear of change is irrational &#8211; Listen, Concrete examples</li>
	<li>Make developers resonsible for uptime &#8211; Pagers</li>
</ul>
<h2><span class="caps">FUD</span></h2>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always done this&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;That can&#8217;t work here&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;This is all about one group or another&#8221;</li>
	<li>&#8220;You&#8217;re an elitist bunch of Europeans&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dangers</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Marketing speak</li>
	<li>Lip service</li>
	<li>Disenchantment</li>
	<li>Disenfranchisement</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<ul>
	<li>&#8220;Not about a person, or a team. About changing how your operations team works&#8221;</li>
	<li>Automate away small boring repetative tasks to make time for interesting activities</li>
	<li>Embed ops people into dev teams</li>
	<li>Drag devs to ops standups</li>
	<li>Build shared appreciation</li>
	<li>Metrics conversations are really powerful</li>
</ul>

    <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2011</span>

    <p>I had the pleasure of speaking at <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/">Fosdem</a> last weekend to a packed <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2011/schedule/track/configuration_systems_management_devroom">Configuration amd systems management devroom</a>.</p>
<p>My presentation covered some of the same ground as recent blog posts, namely why you should be using virtualisation and config management tools to manage your local development environment.</p>
<p><object id="__sse6836888" width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=configmanagamentfordevelopmentenvironments-110207033122-phpapp02&stripped_title=config-managament-for-development-environments-6836888&userName=garethr" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"/><embed name="__sse6836888" src="http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=configmanagamentfordevelopmentenvironments-110207033122-phpapp02&stripped_title=config-managament-for-development-environments-6836888&userName=garethr" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p>
<p>People even said <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/unixdaemon/status/34209307390124033">nice things</a> about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@garethr basically has this subject completely covered. He&#8217;s even advocating the correct editor. excellent #fosdem talk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All in all another good event, I have notes about some of the other talks I went along to that I&#8217;ll try write up soon.</p>
