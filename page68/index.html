    <p>I dont often ramble about accessibility issues on here, something I&#8217;ve only just noticed. Quite suprising as it&#8217;s one of those things that I&#8217;m pretty interested in &#8211; and have been for a good long time.</p>
 <p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve just finished reading through <a href="http://www.bsi-global.com/ICT/PAS78/index.xalter"><span class="caps">PAS</span> 78</a> or Publicly Available Specification 78, Guide to Good Practice in Commissioning Accessible Websites. It&#8217;s a document aimed at those buying websites, especially in the public sector, who probably know accessibility is <em>a good think</em> but could get easily hoodwinked by anyone with even a modicum of knowledge and evil intentions.</p>
 <p>Rather than just provide information about the what and why, considering the doc was launched a month ago, I&#8217;ll just point you to <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk/blog/access/Pas78Launch">a good synopsis</a> from <a href="http://www.isolani.co.uk">Isolani</a>. A few other notables have posted good reads. <a href="http://joeclark.org/">Joe Clark</a>, as always, has <a href="http://blog.fawny.org/2006/03/21/pas78/">an opinion</a> which is both anally detailed and all true. <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk">Bruce</a> also has a <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/pas78">run down</a> from a (some what) insiders point of view.</p>
 <p>My feeling was, overall, pretty positive. I&#8217;d love to see all the clients I deal with having read this. It&#8217;s a pretty good intro to the issues at hand, though it is maybe a little long and technical for some of its audience. One area in particular that got quite a bit of coverage, rightly so in my mind, was testing. Their still isn&#8217;t enough testing of any sorts for websites, even with all these <em>beta</em>  tags going around. The testing area covers all sorts of bits and pieces, again not in enough detail for the implementor but certainly enough for any good procurement office to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff.</p>
 <p>A good series of mentions goes to <a href="http://www.usabilitynet.org/tools/13407stds.htm"><span class="caps">ISO</span> 13407</a> which covers Human centred design processes for interactive systems and as luck would have it the subject of a workshop I&#8217;m attending with <a href="http://osiris.sunderland.ac.uk/~cs0gco/">Gilbert</a> in Sunderland on monday. More on that after the fact.</p>
 <p>Anyhow. I&#8217;d recommend getting your bosses to pay the Ã‚Â£30 (or for bosses, stump up your selves) for the <span class="caps">PAS</span> 78 <span class="caps">PDF</span>. It&#8217;s a pretty good read anyhow, and hopefully more and more proper clients will be reading it soon. Forewarned is forearmed as they say.</p>

        Playing with Python - first impressions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>Ok, well not quite first impressions. I&#8217;ve dabbled before but not for a particular reason and never actually built anything &#8211; but I&#8217;ve spent most of today getting stuck into <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>.</p>
 <p>I have a couple of reasons for wanting to learn another language properly, and I&#8217;m more interested in Python as a general scripting language than as a replacement for <span class="caps">PHP</span> as my web language of choice (Rails hasn&#8217;t really caught me  yet, sorry). I could do some of this with <span class="caps">PHP</span> I know but that brings me to my second reason. I&#8217;ve been reading the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">Pragmatic Programmer</a> recently and one of the things it has to say is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Learn at least one new [programming] language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways. By learning several different approaches, you can help broaden your thinking and avoid getting stuck in a rut.&#8221; <br />
The Pragmatic Programmer</p>
</blockquote>
 <p>I like the idea of that. The rest of the book has a number of interesting things to say about programming in general, much of which is easily actionable.</p>
 <p>A few of my <a href="http://kryogenix.org/">regular</a> <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">reads</a> sing occasionally about the joys of Python, which was probably another reason I&#8217;ve gone that way as well.</p>
 <p>Anyway, first impressions is that Python is pretty easy to pick up. I keep wanting to put in braces and semi-colons but looking at the code it looks clean, simple and readable. Arrays, string functions and flow control appear to be present and correct. They work how you would expect which is what you want really for core functionality. Objects are next on my list of things to look at.</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m building a simple log file analysis tool as I go. I&#8217;m fine with it being a command line app to be honest, but I might end up tinkering with some of the <span class="caps">GUI</span> features at a later date. One of the reasons for going for Python was it&#8217;s flexibility in this regard. Hopefully building something as I go will make it more likely that I&#8217;ll keep playing. I have a couple of other sample apps I&#8217;d like to make as well which is probably a good thing again to maintain interest.</p>
 <p>Anyway, depending on how things go some more comments or code may emerge. Anyone else taking similar advice to learn new languages? If so which ones?</p>

        The Wisdom of Clouds
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">20 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m playing with a few thinks at the moment and one of those had me thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">tag clouds</a>. For those who dont spend time on <a href="http://flickr.com">flickr</a> or similar you may not have seen then, or at least heard of the terminology. All we are really taking about here is a visually weighted list.</p>
 <p>I dont agree with <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0505a.shtml">Jeffrey here</a> unfortunately, who has issues. I can see the point, that sometimes information is better organised by one person than many (think your weekly food shopping list) but in some cases it can be nice &#8211; especially where it provides an alternative navigation method. Maybe I just missed the part where everyone had a tag cloud? I&#8217;d love to see, for instance, a tag cloud on <a href="http://last.fm">last.fm</a> of bands that I might like based on my listening habits, and those of a similar musical persuasion.</p>
 <p>An <a href="http://www.joelamantia.com/blog/archives/ideas/second_generation_tag_clouds.html">interesting article</a> on where next for tags clouds throws up a few interesting points but one thing I have not seen discussed at all is the accessibility angle. Visual prominence is one thing, but without some sort of semantic prominence those not viewing the content visually lose out. A very unscientific survery involving the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/">del.icio.us tag cloud</a> confirmed what I though would probably be the case &#8211; the visual effects (ie. bigger or highlighted text) are implemented purely via classes on the links.</p>
 <p>What would be the effect of using plain links, moving to <em>emphasis</em> for the next level, up to <strong>strong</strong> for the really important tags? We can style the content exactly the same as before, but we have added some sematic prominence to the content.</p>
 <p>Anyone had any experience implementing tag clouds in live projects? Even better, anyone had experience of user testing such interface devices? Real bonus points for accessibility related testing.</p>

        Reading up on a speedy industry
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Mar 2006</span>

    <p>I had cause today to stop and think about books relevant to learning the bigger picture side of building web sites and applications. Code, graphic design, whatever your bag in between, you are either aiming to become, will become or at least affected by people in management positions. Even small companies are not immune, though they can avoid some of the problems (but often by causing some other ones as well.)</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m a big fan of books, I read lots online but when it comes to regular, night after night reading I much prefer to be in bed with a book than a laptop. I have no problem at all falling asleep and the book falling lightly on the floor for the morning.</p>
 <p>Books do however date, or rather some do, or maybe if you take them as gospel they do. Anyhow, I see them as useful &#8211; perhaps even more so in distilling knowledge for consumption by other, less obsessive, members of out industry?</p>
 <p>Without further ado I present a short(ish) list of books I think everyone involved in web software should read:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0974514047">Ship It!: A Practical Guide to Successful Software Projects</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001088">The Cathedral &#38; the Bazaar</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735713286">Web Design on a Shoestring</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712026">Return on Design: Smarter Web Design for Hard Times </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735712018">Designing with Web Standards</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789723700">The Art and Science of Web Design</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959">The Mythical Man Month</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735714339">Web Redesign Workflow that Works</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Some are most definately on the software side, others very web centric while more still are a little older and just plain odd. However all of them serve a purpose, they let people see into a way of thinking. The idea that programmers are <em>wizards</em> annoys me. It&#8217;s not magic, it&#8217;s creativity, just with tools most people are not familiar with.</p>
 <p>If you are someone involved with the building of appications give some of the above a try if you ever feel like reading up on something different, apart from the latest <a href="http://cssmastery.com"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a> or <a href="http://domscripting.com/">Javascript</a> tricks.</p>
 <p>If your involved in the management of projects but come from a non software (dont kid yourself because it&#8217;s the web it&#8217;s not software) background then dive in. You&#8217;ll start to understand some of the little bits that puzzle you so.</p>
 <p>Anyone else got any books in a similar vein? I&#8217;m always on the look out for an interesting read. Or do you complely disagree &#8211; do you even still read books?</p>
