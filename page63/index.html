    <span class="post-date">02 Sep 2006</span>

    <p><strong>Update</strong> A few additions I thought I&#8217;d add here rather than keep for another post. <a href="http://sarat.pediredla.name/">Sarat</a> just messaged me with a link to <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/beta/cxmac/">CrossOver Mac</a>. I now have IE 6 running natively on my mac. Which is nice. I also installed <a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/">Twisted</a> but that&#8217;s probably for later too.</p>
 <p>I finally got round to getting myself a new MacBook (only a week or so after <a href="http://xlab.co.uk">Phil</a>) and a nice piece of kit it is too. I decided not to simply plug it into my previous machine via firewire and port everything across. I sort of figured something would break moving from a G4 to the new Intel machines but I think the real reason was that I quite like setting up a fresh machine. It might just be me but I quite like installing and tweaking things.</p>
 <p>I thought, for posterity, I&#8217;d post a list of the things I installed and some of the tweaks I got up to.</p>
 <p>First things first. I installed most of these apps into a Personal folder in the Applications folder, just to keep them separate from the preinstalled Apple applications.</p>

  <li><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>As nice as the OS X interface is a couple of small additions can&#8217;t hurt. With all the talk about <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/spaces.html">Spaces</a> of late I&#8217;m not sure if people had come across <a href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/">Desktop Manager</a> before. It&#8217;s basically spaces, or virtual desktops, now.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://desktopmanager.berlios.de/">Desktop Manager</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>I also include a few Apple apps in my dock that I use on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Preview</li>
  <li>DigitalColorMeter</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/unix/">Terminal</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/safari">Safari</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>I&#8217;m a <span class="caps">UNIX</span> geek at heart, from even before OS X moved in that direction, and both <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> and <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">Darwin Ports</a> make grabbing most packages easy enough.</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">Darwin Ports</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Web development is what I do, and I couldn&#8217;t be doing that without a handfull of frameworks could I?</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page">Mono</a></li>
</ul>
 <p>Their are lots of ways of setting up the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> <a href="http://www.php.net/"><span class="caps">PHP</span></a> stack on OS X, the OS already includes versions of Apache and <span class="caps">PHP</span> in fact. I instead went for using the <a href="http://www.mamp.info/"><span class="caps">MAMP</span></a> installer to avoid the likely problems of upgrading from source the preinstalled versions. I then got to work tweaking and twisting the default <span class="caps">MAMP</span> install into shape, adding th ability to quickly setup virtual hosts, a central code library repository, sorting paths out and setting up Python support. I hope to post about this later on in more detail.</p>
<ul>

        Learning Modern Web Design
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2006</span>

    <p>How do you convince people you know what you&#8217;re talking about? I mean, if someone wants to double check that you have a clue about web design where can they go? I&#8217;m not talking about the little things &#8211; <span class="caps">CSS</span> hacks, binary things which are right or wrong based on something obvious &#8211; I&#8217;m mean the nearly imperceptible little bits that all come together to make the sum bigger than its parts. I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://garrettdimon.com">Garrett Dimon&#8217;s</a> concept of <a href="http://www.garrettdimon.com/archives/the-time-is-now-for-front-end-architects">Front End Architecture</a> as a good example of this.</p>
 <p>If you&#8217;re an expert too, no problem. You visit your personal set of blogs, ask a few people over on the lists you inhabit, <a href="http://digg.com">digg</a> out articles you read ages ago and added to <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. You learn something new and get on with your work.</p>
 <p>But what if you&#8217;re involved in management? Or are bringing your expertise from another field to web design (say marketing, or graphic design, all things you need)? Of course you need to trust the experts but it would still be useful to have at least a <em>big picture</em> idea about what is going on. It&#8217;s the same for specialists &#8211; someone working day in, day out with <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> doesn&#8217;t need to know the in&#8217;s and outs of <span class="caps">CSS</span> in IE7, but having the big picture &#8211; from architecture to usability &#8211; is going to be useful.</p>
 <p>I started gathering some of this information together as a resource for work. One thing I noticed was that it was pretty much impossible to find the sort of theory based resources I was looking for without knowing where they were already. Specific blog posts (just blog URLs are too big a moving target to be useful for something so focused), online magazines, podcasts and books; their is so much information around, and much of it out of date or not useful enough to begin with. An expert can filter this, often without even thinking about it, but what about a non expert?</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m going to gather this information together somewhere in the hopefully not too distant future but in the meantime does anyone know of any similar resources already out there? Where would you send your marketing savvy boss to get a feel for Ajax? or your best developer to get the skinny on usability?</p>

    <span class="post-date">23 Aug 2006</span>

    <p>Some interesting observations after a post and comments over at <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/journal/345/review-newsgator-online">The Watchmaker Project</a></p>
 <p>It turns out, after me jumping to conclusions, that the interface for <a href="http://newsgator.com">Newsgator Online</a> (my favourite newsreader for the last year or so since I went web native) varies depending on locale. From a brief look at the US, French and UK versions the US version has a newer (and from a quick look nicer) interface than the others.</p>
 <p>First the US only version:</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethr/223079659/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/81/223079659_bd1c59c415_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
 <p>And then the UK (the French version is the same, except with the relevant language changes):</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethr/223060658/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/86/223060658_ec4901fa9f_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
 <p>The usability issue I have with this is the user chooses the locale when they login, wherever you login from (<a href="http://newsgator.com">newsgator.com</a>, <a href="http://newsgator.co.uk">newsgator.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://newsgator.fr">newsgator.fr</a>). OK so it&#8217;s an edge case issue, but I now know I have a choice of interfaces. Do I stick with being honest and saying I&#8217;m a brit and get an seemingly inferior interface? or do I lie and pretend to be a yank? If I was a French speaker I wouldn&#8217;t have that choice either? I dont actually know yet. I&#8217;m definately going to lie a few times just to see the new features and the interface though.</p>

    <p>On occasion I even surprise myself. Sometimes you just need to geek. Rob at work was discussing his ideal device, basically something that would read text based <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds to him while in the bath in the morning. Lazy I know.</p>
 <p>I thought to myself <em>That cant be too difficult</em> and I&#8217;ve never played with any text to speach stuff before and off I went. A few hours later and I just got my Windows machine to read out the top story from this site.</p>
 <p>Python is so cool to just hack in. Did I mention that before? I&#8217;ve yet to do anything <em>real</em> in it, but playing around with code is nice. Anyway, on with a solution;</p>
 <p>Lots of things to install first. As mentioned I used Windows, in this case so I could access the Win32 Speech <span class="caps">API</span>. I looked at using <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> on Unix but left that for now. Tools of choice were <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> 2.4 with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">Win32 extensions</a>. A couple of Python modules do most of the work. First up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyTTS</a> which deals with the text to speach and <span class="caps">SAPI</span> integration. Next comes the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module. I&#8217;d heard this mentioned by <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/08/08/ydn">Simon</a> over on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/python/python-rss.html">Yahoo Python developer network</a> and it really is nice.</p>
 <p>The rest was easy.<code>&lt;pre&gt;import pyTTS
import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse("http://morethanseven.net/rss")
tts = pyTTS.Create()
tts.Speak(d['items'][0].description)&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
 <p>Ok, so this isn&#8217;t an application. Just a proof of concept but you get the idea and I dont really want or need this app anyway. Why then? because I thought I could. Oh, and Python&#8217;s interactive prompt is so cool. I want one for everything.</p>

    <p>Well, Christian&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.beginningjavascript.com">Begining Javascript with <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting and Ajax</a> is out and, as of writing this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590596803/202-8465886-9794241?v=glance&#38;n=266239">Amazon UK</a> only have four copies left so hopefully that&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
 <p>A quick competition on the site peaked my amusometer and I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
 <p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/97/209018272_66abe7c6ea.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></p>
 <p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/newcoverforbeginningjavascript/">flickr</a> for more hopefully.</p>
 <p><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Everyone</a> <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">who</a> <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/journal/">is</a> <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">everyone</a> already resides at <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!, with more <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">recent</a> <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">movers</a> that you can shake a stick at.  I&#8217;d just like to make a couple of observations:</p>
 <p>Both <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/297/joining-yahoo">Drew</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/07/12/joining-yahoo/">Stuart</a> posted posts titled <strong>Joining Yahoo!</strong>. The brain washing obviously starts in the interviews so you have been warned!</p>
 <p>The upcoming <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon">BarCampLondon</a> event is being held at the Yahoo offices in London. I&#8217;m thinking about going along, but I&#8217;m scared Yahoo might not let all those talented developers leave on the sunday?</p>
