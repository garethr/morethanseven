        Learning Modern Web Design

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">29 Aug 2006</span>

    <p>How do you convince people you know what you&#8217;re talking about? I mean, if someone wants to double check that you have a clue about web design where can they go? I&#8217;m not talking about the little things &#8211; <span class="caps">CSS</span> hacks, binary things which are right or wrong based on something obvious &#8211; I&#8217;m mean the nearly imperceptible little bits that all come together to make the sum bigger than its parts. I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://garrettdimon.com">Garrett Dimon&#8217;s</a> concept of <a href="http://www.garrettdimon.com/archives/the-time-is-now-for-front-end-architects">Front End Architecture</a> as a good example of this.</p>
 <p>If you&#8217;re an expert too, no problem. You visit your personal set of blogs, ask a few people over on the lists you inhabit, <a href="http://digg.com">digg</a> out articles you read ages ago and added to <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. You learn something new and get on with your work.</p>
 <p>But what if you&#8217;re involved in management? Or are bringing your expertise from another field to web design (say marketing, or graphic design, all things you need)? Of course you need to trust the experts but it would still be useful to have at least a <em>big picture</em> idea about what is going on. It&#8217;s the same for specialists &#8211; someone working day in, day out with <span class="caps">ASP</span>.<span class="caps">NET</span> doesn&#8217;t need to know the in&#8217;s and outs of <span class="caps">CSS</span> in IE7, but having the big picture &#8211; from architecture to usability &#8211; is going to be useful.</p>
 <p>I started gathering some of this information together as a resource for work. One thing I noticed was that it was pretty much impossible to find the sort of theory based resources I was looking for without knowing where they were already. Specific blog posts (just blog URLs are too big a moving target to be useful for something so focused), online magazines, podcasts and books; their is so much information around, and much of it out of date or not useful enough to begin with. An expert can filter this, often without even thinking about it, but what about a non expert?</p>
 <p>I&#8217;m going to gather this information together somewhere in the hopefully not too distant future but in the meantime does anyone know of any similar resources already out there? Where would you send your marketing savvy boss to get a feel for Ajax? or your best developer to get the skinny on usability?</p>

    <p>Some interesting observations after a post and comments over at <a href="http://www.thewatchmakerproject.com/journal/345/review-newsgator-online">The Watchmaker Project</a></p>
 <p>It turns out, after me jumping to conclusions, that the interface for <a href="http://newsgator.com">Newsgator Online</a> (my favourite newsreader for the last year or so since I went web native) varies depending on locale. From a brief look at the US, French and UK versions the US version has a newer (and from a quick look nicer) interface than the others.</p>
 <p>First the US only version:</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethr/223079659/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/81/223079659_bd1c59c415_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
 <p>And then the UK (the French version is the same, except with the relevant language changes):</p>
 <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/garethr/223060658/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/86/223060658_ec4901fa9f_m.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
 <p>The usability issue I have with this is the user chooses the locale when they login, wherever you login from (<a href="http://newsgator.com">newsgator.com</a>, <a href="http://newsgator.co.uk">newsgator.co.uk</a> or <a href="http://newsgator.fr">newsgator.fr</a>). OK so it&#8217;s an edge case issue, but I now know I have a choice of interfaces. Do I stick with being honest and saying I&#8217;m a brit and get an seemingly inferior interface? or do I lie and pretend to be a yank? If I was a French speaker I wouldn&#8217;t have that choice either? I dont actually know yet. I&#8217;m definately going to lie a few times just to see the new features and the interface though.</p>

    <p>On occasion I even surprise myself. Sometimes you just need to geek. Rob at work was discussing his ideal device, basically something that would read text based <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds to him while in the bath in the morning. Lazy I know.</p>
 <p>I thought to myself <em>That cant be too difficult</em> and I&#8217;ve never played with any text to speach stuff before and off I went. A few hours later and I just got my Windows machine to read out the top story from this site.</p>
 <p>Python is so cool to just hack in. Did I mention that before? I&#8217;ve yet to do anything <em>real</em> in it, but playing around with code is nice. Anyway, on with a solution;</p>
 <p>Lots of things to install first. As mentioned I used Windows, in this case so I could access the Win32 Speech <span class="caps">API</span>. I looked at using <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> on Unix but left that for now. Tools of choice were <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> 2.4 with the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/">Win32 extensions</a>. A couple of Python modules do most of the work. First up <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/uncassist">pyTTS</a> which deals with the text to speach and <span class="caps">SAPI</span> integration. Next comes the <a href="http://feedparser.org/">Feedparser</a> module. I&#8217;d heard this mentioned by <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2006/08/08/ydn">Simon</a> over on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/python/python-rss.html">Yahoo Python developer network</a> and it really is nice.</p>
 <p>The rest was easy.<code>&lt;pre&gt;import pyTTS
import feedparser
d = feedparser.parse("http://morethanseven.net/rss")
tts = pyTTS.Create()
tts.Speak(d['items'][0].description)&lt;/pre&gt;</code></p>
 <p>Ok, so this isn&#8217;t an application. Just a proof of concept but you get the idea and I dont really want or need this app anyway. Why then? because I thought I could. Oh, and Python&#8217;s interactive prompt is so cool. I want one for everything.</p>

    <p>Well, Christian&#8217;s book, <a href="http://www.beginningjavascript.com">Begining Javascript with <span class="caps">DOM</span> Scripting and Ajax</a> is out and, as of writing this <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1590596803/202-8465886-9794241?v=glance&#38;n=266239">Amazon UK</a> only have four copies left so hopefully that&#8217;s a good sign.</p>
 <p>A quick competition on the site peaked my amusometer and I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>

 <p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tags/newcoverforbeginningjavascript/">flickr</a> for more hopefully.</p>
 <p><a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Everyone</a> <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com">who</a> <a href="http://www.paulhammond.org/journal/">is</a> <a href="http://cackhanded.net/">everyone</a> already resides at <span class="caps">YAHOO</span>!, with more <a href="http://allinthehead.com/">recent</a> <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/">movers</a> that you can shake a stick at.  I&#8217;d just like to make a couple of observations:</p>
 <p>Both <a href="http://allinthehead.com/retro/297/joining-yahoo">Drew</a> and <a href="http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2006/07/12/joining-yahoo/">Stuart</a> posted posts titled <strong>Joining Yahoo!</strong>. The brain washing obviously starts in the interviews so you have been warned!</p>
 <p>The upcoming <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampLondon">BarCampLondon</a> event is being held at the Yahoo offices in London. I&#8217;m thinking about going along, but I&#8217;m scared Yahoo might not let all those talented developers leave on the sunday?</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Jul 2006</span>

    <p>I&#8217;m working on some redesign work for one of my under maintained sites at the moment, with something of a redesign in the works. It seemed a good opportunity to play more with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"><span class="caps">YUI</span></a>, the Yahoo User Interface Library, which I&#8217;d had a peak at before and heard nice things about (sorry, I like the long namespaces).</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve nothing finished yet past a proof of concept, but I thought a couple of lines of javascript wouldn&#8217;t go a miss. Nothing fancy mind, just some nice bits I like so far.</p>
 <p>The case in point was wanting to add event handlers to an unknown number of links within an unordered list.</p>
 <p>First off a quick, clever, one liner. <em>onAvailable</em> checks for the availability of the object (if you remove the quotes) or an object with a specified id in this case. It executes the callback function, <em>init</em> in this case, when the condition is true.</p>
<div><code>YAHOO.util.Event.onAvailable("iList", init);</code></div>
 <p>Moments later we have events added to all the links.</p>
<div><code>&lt;pre&gt;
function init() {
   var links = document.getElementById("iList").getElementsByTagName("A");
   YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(links, "click", clickCallback);
}&lt;/pre&gt;</code></div>
 <p>Again you just throw in whatever you happen to be working with (in this case an array returned by <em>getElementsByTagName</em>) and everything just gets dealt with. I originally had a <em>for</em> loop, iterating over the links and adding events, then I worked out <span class="caps">YUI</span> just did it all for me if I let it. I like that. I <strong>could</strong> have done it myself. <span class="caps">YUI</span> would have let me and not complained. But if I want to delve a bit I can find cool, quick, clean ways of doing the same thing. I refactored my code, with the help of <span class="caps">YUI</span> in ten minutes. I like that, but I think I said that.</p>
